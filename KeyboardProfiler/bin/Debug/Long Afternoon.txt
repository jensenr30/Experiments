      Author’s note(s):
      There are several references to Futurama in this story. try to find them.
      There is no relation between the character Grey and my older brother Matthew.
















      Grey dragged himself through his 13 bedroom, 10 bath mansion. He was bored beyond belief. “Goddamn it” He said as he sank into his dirty couch, cursing at no person or thing in particular. After a few minutes of staring lazily off into space, Niklas - Grey’s younger brother - walked into the living room.
      “Hey big bro,” Niklas said.
      “Goddamn...” Grey replied. This time, cursing at his younger brother specifically. His body had, for some reason, started sweating at an ungodly rate in the now damp, dirty couch.
      “I’ve got a few things that I’d like you to do around the house.”
      “What the fuck are you talking about?”
      “Chores, Grey. Some chores need to be done around the house.”
      “What was that!??!”
      “What was what?” Niklas replied.
      “That sound! I think I hear leaves rustling! I think...someone is watching us!”
      “Grey, for the last time, you aren’t in Vietnam. You never were.”
      “Shhhhh! I need to get my pistol. I’ll be right back.” Grey pushed himself out of his grimy couch and started walking away from his younger brother.
      “You don’t have a pistol, Grey!” Niklas shouted after him “And you can’t keep putting off these chores!” Niklas scowled.
      After Grey had walked away from his brother, He walked downstairs and sank into the basement couch. It was a couch of equally filthy proportions. He turned on the 308 inch TV immediately after sinking into the greasy cushions. Jersey Shore was on TV. It was his favorite show, so Grey started yelling angrily at the sofa.
      Grey started shaking violently. It was two o'clock in the afternoon and he had already drank a case and a half of that generic, off-brand cola from Wal-Mart. He thought that his shaking subsided while drinking the cola; he thought the cola was fending off the shakes. In reality, it only distracted him from the shaking while actually making it worse. Grey was as ignorant as he was careless. He reached down in between the cushions of his couch and retrieved a can of his favorite cola. He tried to open the can, but it wouldn’t stop shaking. Both his hands were shaking violently due to excessive amounts of caffeine. Grey threw his can of cola on the floor and pouted. He sat there for a minute, staring at the TV, and hating the can of generic, off-brand cola. He let out a sigh and yelled up the stairs to his younger brother.
      “Nick!” Grey shouted.
      Niklas pulled himself away from his computer where he was working and walked over to the top of the staircase. “What!” Niklas yelled down the stairs.
      “Help me open my pop!”
      “Why?”
      “Because I’m thirsty!” Grey responded
      “No Shit! Why do you need ME!? Aren’t you capable of opening a can of pop!?” Niklas replied.
      “My can won’t stop shaking!”
      “Uuggghhhhhhhh,” Niklas moaned. “Ok. I’ll open your pop after you complete one of your chores!” he yelled down the stairs.
      “NO!” Grey said.
      Niklas abandoned the hopeless conversation and returned to his computer. He continued answering his business emails.
      Grey got out, up, and off of his couch (in that order). He walked shakily over to the bar area where he pulled up a chair and set his cola down on the bar. A frown formed on Grey’s face as he grabbed a spoon and started hitting the can of cola with it. It didn’t work the first fifteen times, so he tried it once more. Alas, it didn’t work the sixteenth time. who would have guessed... He got pissed off. “This is all your fault, NICK!” Grey yelled up the stairs. Niklas heard him, but ignored his crazed ranting. His business emails were more important.
      Grey was fed up with his stupid can. He held onto the spoon with both hands and swung at his cola like a golf pro! The impact blew a hole in the side of the can and sent it flying across the room onto his couch. “FORE!” Grey exclaimed as he threw the spoon onto the floor and ran over to his couch. He jumped a solid eight feet and landed on the couch, foaming at the mouth. The pop can was spilling its contents all over the couch. Grey started lapping it up. He jammed his head in between the couch cushions and violently jerked back and forth as he ingested the cola. The caffeinated, sugary drink was slurped up in a flash. In between the cushions there was a load of dirt, crumbs, dust, coins, hair, and stale popcorn. He ate everything. There was a cola-soaked chunk of almond that he found particularly delectable.
      Niklas had heard a loud WHACK when Grey smacked his cola and the subsequent “FORE!” Niklas knew this couldn’t be good, but he really didn’t feel like going downstairs to try to deal with his older brother. He just kept on plowing through the business emails. It seemed as though the emails poured in as fast as he answered them. Niklas needed a break.
      Lucy for Niklas, he was very self-aware. He knew he needed a break, so he took one. Relaxation, he decided, was what he needed. He was going to sit on the upstairs couch, but it was filthy for god knows what reason. My god! Niklas thought. What the hell has Grey been doing to this couch?? How could anyone make a couch THIS DIRTY without actually trying?
      Not only did Niklas find that the couch was dirty, but it was coated in grease. He shuddered. “Grey!” Niklas shouted down the stairs.
      “Goddamn it, Nick!” Grey replied, “I’m watching Jersey Shore!”
      “I’m getting rid of this couch, Grey.”
      “No!”
      “I’m going to make a trip to the furniture store to get a new couch for the upstairs.”
      “Don’t get rid of Uppy! She’s my favorite couch! Other than Downy.” Yes. Grey had, in fact, named the couches according to their place in the giant house. He had named them with such a lack of creativity that it had made Niklas sick. Literally! Niklas was sick with the flu for a week because of that awful lack of inspiration. When Grey had told Niklas that the couches had received the names uppy and downy, Niklas was afflicted with a debilitating sickness. However, it could have been the disgusting state of the couch that had induced the virus. Seriously, those couches are fucking nasty.
      “You can keep Uppy, but you’ll have to keep her in your room.” Niklas said.
      “All the better! We’ll be able to spend more quality time together if you know what i mean.”
      Niklas grimaced. He had known for a while that his older brother had odd couch fetishes, but it never failed to creep him out.
      “Our relationship has been a bit rocky lately, but I think that more time alone together will help us out.” Grey said.
      Niklas remained silent, trying to deny that his brother was actually saying these things. When all of this began about a year ago, Niklas had said “Grey. You’re a thirty-four year old man. You need to stop living in this couch fantasy-world of yours. It’s insane and childish.” This, however, didn’t snap Grey out of it. He continued on living in his imagination where couches are people too.
      Grey drug uppy down the staircase, took her into his room, and locked the door. On that note, Niklas walked out the upstairs front door of the mansion and got into his yellow Jeep. Upon stepping into his car, he found a little box on the dashboard. Niklas cocked his head and pondered whence the little box had come from. He didn’t remember buying the box and he hadn’t received it as a gift. It was truly a mystery.
      The box was red with purple stripes and about two inches wide, two inches tall, and two inches deep. That would make it a total of 8 cubic inches. This would also make it have a surface area of 24 square inches. Niklas reached out to grab it and he found that it weighed well under a pound. It was a few ounces at most. The box was made of paper, but not thin paper. Card stock was what Niklas presumed it to be constructed with. The card stock paper box was pleasing to hold. It was quaint, and yet, it was sophisticated at the same time. The box seemed to be able to appear simple to those who perceived it to be simple, but unimaginably complex to those who could comprehend it majestically intricate nature.
      What is the box trying to tell me? Niklas thought. He stared at the box, all the while wishing he could know why the box was there and what it was trying to accomplish.  Do I need to open you to find your message? Niklas stopped at that thought. No. Opening you is the obvious reaction. That is what you expect me to do. What if the lesson you are trying to teach me will be ruined if I open you? However, there is a chance that your message is simply being kept inside you. If that were the case, I would never receive your message if I were to refrain from opening you.
      He didn’t know. But Niklas might never know if he didn’t open the box! I need to open this box! Niklas started breathing heavily. His heart started pounding in his chest. Niklas was confused and scared and excited and all at the same time! He closed his eyes and reached out to open the box. His hand came in contact with the box. His fingers grasped the lid of the box. He removed the lid and opened his eyes to see what the box contained!
      Niklas saw the box was empty so he threw it in the trash.

      *    *    *

      After spending some time in his room with Uppy, Grey decided to go out and roam the house. He stopped by the fridge in the bar area and grabbed a few pops for his excursion out into his own house. He chugged the first one and put the other two in his pockets.
      He walked over to downy and poured one of his remaining two Sam’s Cola drinks onto the couch. “Perfect.” He said, and walked upstairs to the living room. He looked around the living room for potted plants. He spied one sitting on the windowsill overlooking the backyard. He took it and ran downstairs with it. Once he got down the staircase, he chucked the potted plant violently at Downy. The pot that held the plant exploded on impact with the abused couch. Grey had made sure the throw it with enough force to completely shatter the ceramic plant encasement.
      He jumped a solid 20 feet across the room and onto his abused couch, Downy. Even if he was slowly killing himself through a toxic daily dose of caffeine, at least he was utilizing all the energy he got from the disturbingly sweet drink.
      When he himself impacted the couch, he instantly began driving and grinding the dirt into the couch. He pushed the topsoil in between the cushions and mashed it into the fabric. Downy thanked him for doing this. If Grey didn’t hold to his specific couch-care routine, his couches would greatly suffer. That was Grey’s version of reality.

      add this stuff somehow:
      the couch cushions are dirty because grey throws dirt and clay and decomposing organic matter on the couch and grinds it into the couch. He then jams seeds into the couch ( between cushions) and then pours an ungodly amount of spoon bash of the couch. He expects the seeds to grow. When they don’t grow, grey gets extremely mad and rips apart the couch. he reupholsters the couch after destroying it. When this is all done, he dumps a single can of spoon bash onto the couch to christen it. (he calls cola spoon bash because he always bashes the living hell out of it with a spoon). Grey was in a relationship with uppy, but uppy dumped him. he still sits in her, though. sitting in a couch is not what grey thinks of as having sex with a couch. he considers having sex with a couch to be having sex with a couch. I will never write that grey has sex, I will always imply it. I will never describe anything relating to how grey has sex with these couches. I don’t even want to think about that... somewhere in this story, grey should say something like “Uppy sure is a wild one. she knows how to please a man”. Niklas is scarred for life. when Niklas hears this, he finally gets fed up with his brother’s weird fantasy and throws uppy out into the front lawn and sets her on fire. Grey cries. “She may have been a whore, but she was still a human being!”. grey cries as uppy burns. soon after, grey gets into a relationship with downy (his ex-lover) and tells Niklas “I know she is bad for me, and I know she is just using me, but i need her. She really does ease the pain and sooth my soul.”
      idea:
      grey stubbed his toe on the base of a fan. "Ahhhg!" he says "I HATE THIS FAN!"
      grey talks to Niklas about why it was the fan's fault that he stubbed his toe.
      Niklas doesn't believe him. grey has a 15 minute speech/lecture in his own home. Niklas sits and listens to him talk about why it was the fan's fault that he stubbed his toe. Niklas is still skeptical. grey writes an argumentative essay that explains in 23 pages why the fan is to blame for his stubbed toe. Grey reads it and starts to actually be convinced that it was the fan's fault.
