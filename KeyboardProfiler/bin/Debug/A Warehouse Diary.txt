    The original digital version of “A Warehouse Diary” (circa 2010) was lost.3 All that I could find was a printed version I had lying around. This version will not be an exact replica.
    I’m a different person than I was 3 years ago. As such, this version will differ from the original in many minor ways. I will be making many little changes to the original text. Some days in Chapter 1 will be omitted, and others added. That being said, the story will follow the same idea and general story arc.
    
    
    
    
    
Author’s Note
    You’re about to enter a world where my pseudo-philosophy and humor are mashed together with science fiction, thus creating a horrible, convoluted mess. Good luck.

Chapter 1
A Soul Found Lost


Day One
    I awoke in an abandoned warehouse. I had nothing but a shirt on. I walked around and tried to find a way out, but there was none. No door. No exit. I wondered how in the hell I ended up inside the building. I closely examined the four walls, the floor and the ceiling; but there was no sign of an exit or entrance. There were only the cold steel walls to confine me.
Day Two
    There is small puddle of water in a corner of the Warehouse that I’ve been drinking from to stay alive. It tastes really metallic, but it’s all I’ve got in here. I wonder why there aren’t windows in this place… maybe this place was a sweat shop?1
Day Three
    It is deadly silent in the Warehouse. I still think about finding a way out of the Warehouse, but I’m losing hope with every passing hour in here. What lies on the other side of these walls? The outdoors, maybe? Or what if this warehouse is the only thing that is or ever will be? I’d like to think that my future isn’t that grim, but who really knows…
Day Four
    I began to think about what body parts I will eat first. I know I can survive a while without food as long as I have my puddle of water, but I cannot help but think about eating myself. Skin? Toes? Perhaps a tasty Ronald Reagan? Too bad I didn’t have the former president of the United Union to lightly snack on. The only think I did have were the cold steel walls to confine me. They tasted like chicken. And I fucking hate chicken!
Day Five
    Captains log. Star date: 1329.8. I am still stuck in the Warehouse.
Day Six
    I saw a mouse scampering about in the Warehouse. I tried to grab it when it scampered close, but it was too quick for my hands. It ran to the other side of the Warehouse and continued its light scampering. Oh how I hated that mouse. I would love to eat it if only I could get my greasy hands on it. Yeah. I would literally eat the shit out of it. Figuratively.
Day Seven
    My shirt was wrapped around my hands. I held it in the air a foot above the cold concrete floor. All that was left to do was wait for the mouse to scamper under my shirt and I would trap the bastard.
    I waited for over an hour, and the mouse eventually made its way over to me. It seemed mildly cautious. My heart was pounding furiously. Soon after coming over to me, it scampered under my make-shift shirt trap. I slapped my shirt trap down on the mouse and closed the shirt around the mouse like I was tightly wrapping a birthday present. The only difference was that It was my own present that I was wrapping. So needless to say it wasn’t all that great of a birthday.
    I brought the tightly help shirt up to my eye level.
     “How do you like that you little morsel!?” I laughed triumphantly at the little rodent. “I GOT YOU! YOU! YOU PIECE OF SHIT!”
    The mouse squirmed out of the shirt, fell to the ground, and ran away. Subsequently, my jaw dropped. I was utterly and completely speechless. I simply stood there, awestruck, and watched as the rodent scampered off to the other side of the room and ran out the door.
    And then a wave of confusion ran over me. Where?! WHAT?! Where in the hell did that door come from? I was sure that I had looked all over the Warehouse for an exit and didn’t find any. How… Am I just seeing things? I wasn’t just seeing things. And no matter how much I doubted the door’s very existence, I knew that the door was real. I could feel with the door. The door was all like, “Hey, bro. You feel me?” and I was all like, “Yeah. I feel you, door. I feel you inside me.” That being said, in no way did I talk to the door. That would just be silly.
    Ok. Snap out of it. Regardless of whether the door was there before or not, I need to inspect it now. So I walked over to the door. Approaching it, I had to squint my eyes at its brilliance. It was much brighter than anything in the Warehouse. I was almost blinded when I got next to it. I shut my eyes. I stood there for 10 seconds. And it felt like an eternity. What if I’m not supposed to go through this door... But in the end I took the step through the glowing doorway.
Day Eight
    After stepping through the door, I found myself in an identical warehouse. And I don’t mean it was similar in size and appearance. I mean it was the same. Exactly. Upon walking into the second warehouse, I saw my faded red shirt lying on the ground. But that’s impossible... There is no. Fucking. Way. But it was my shirt. I walked up to, picked it up, and even smelled it. It was definitely my shirt. But the evidence didn’t stop me from believing that it wasn’t.
    I span around, shirt in hand, and started to walk back to the first warehouse to see if the shirt was still there. But that would prove to be impossible. Because the door I had walked through was no longer there. It had vanished. Am I… Crazy? Did the door back to the first room disappear? Or did I just hallucinate this whole thing? The door, the mouse, the light… did I just imagine all of that?
    I heard a squeaking. I turned back to see the mouse scampering around. Ok. So at least I didn’t imagine the rodent. Once again, I saw the mouse scamper away and through a door. This is getting weird. I walked after the mouse and went through the doorway. This time I brought the shirt with me. After once again closing my eyes and passing through the brilliant light, I opened my eyes to see my shirt was on the ground in front of me. I didn’t drop it. It was just… there. Instead of being in my hand, it was on the ground. I pointed an accusing finger at the shirt and said, “Stop shifting around on me you jerk!” But I knew it wasn’t the shirt’s fault. And the shirt knew that I knew.
    I turned around again to see that the door had disappeared behind me. This disappearance act again, eh? I turned away from the wall and observed the room. I noticed a small book sitting the corner. I picked it up and inspected it. It looked old. And weathered. It was as if it had been through a lot. On the front were the letters “XXIII”. They didn’t mean anything to me. I opened the book and checked out the read the first page.
Day Nine
    After only a few moments of reading the book, I realized that this book was about… me. This book chronicles what I’ve been doing while I’ve been stuck in the Warehouse. And the book was written from my perspective! It was written as if I was the author! Not only that, but the book includes my thoughts. I don’t know how that is fucking possible. I’m astonished at how… accurate they are. 
    The only things that weren’t accurate were the “Day” system and the footnotes. I’ve only been in the Warehouse for about 4 or 5 days I think. But the book splits up my actions arbitrarily into days. There is no way I’ve been here for 9 days… And the footnotes don’t seem to reflect my thoughts or actions. They are written like… someone is objectively analyzing my thoughts and actions. However, most of the time they are just complete nonsense.
    Regardless of the fine details, when one discovers a book that chronicles one’s life so accurately, one will probably have the urge to read it. So I read. And I didn’t stop. I read through my contemplation of the nature of the Warehouse. I read through my capturing and losing the mouse. And I read through my walking through the brilliantly lit door. The book was written up until the present moment. There were well over half of the pages left blank. It was then that I realized… there was text was appearing on the page.
    The words seemed to fade from white to black. They started faint and blurry, but turned dark and crisp before my eyes. The words appearing on the page were… my present thoughts. The words coming into view reflected what I was thinking! The book was actively recording my thoughts!2
    I closed the book. It stayed shut for around ten seconds before I reopened it… Holy shit. The book wrote that I shut it and then reopened it. It even knew how long I was intending to keep it closed. It’s writing this. It’s writing my thoughts right now. How is this… even… possible!?
    I closed the book. I took in a deep breath, set the book down, and walked through another bright door. I’d hardly call it progress, but it was better than sitting there with that book.
Day Ten
    To my surprise, this room wasn’t another warehouse-esque building. The walls weren’t steel. The floor wasn’t concrete. Instead, the room resembled a cartoonish house from Dr. Seuss’s “How the Grinch Stole Christmas”. I saw the Grinch stuffing boxes and bags of Christmas presents up the fire place chimney. But why? Wouldn’t it be easier to just walk them out the front door? I mean, if you are breaking and entering, you might as well just use the door instead of making it hard for yourself. But I digress.
    The Grinch crept into the kitchen. At that moment, I heard a strangely cool and old timey voice. The masculine voice seemed to come from every direction at once. It said, “He slunk to the ice box. He eyed the who’s feast! He eyed the who berries. He eyed the roast beast! He cleaned out that ice box as quick as a flash! Why that grinch even stole out their last can of whoop-ass!”
Day Twenty Thousand
    I wonder what that stupid “XXIII” book is writing now… I wonder what day it has progressed me to? It put me at day nine yesterday. So maybe I’m on day 11 or 12 now. Who knows. That book was full of shit anyway. For all I know it’s writing that I’m on day twenty thousand.3 Ugh. The thought of my thoughts being written in that book makes me sick… I’ll just try not to think about it… Just gotta keep moving through these rooms…
Day Eleven
    I find myself in a room that looks like a prison lunch room. I notice that I have some weird cloths on. I didn’t put the cloths on, of course. I’m getting used to weird shit like this happening all the time at this point in my series of misadventures in this maze of weird and sometimes elaborate warehouse rooms.
    I grabbed some prison food. It wasn’t great by most people’s standards, but I was starving. So the rations were very well received. Mmmm… These beans are amazing. Oh fresh drinking water. I have missed you so. I didn’t get more than halfway through my meal before a prison lunch riot started. The guards fired shots. The crowd settled down. For a few moments, it was absolutely quiet. People sit at the lunch tables. Their food lying out on said tables. Oh man. I have not seen this much food in a long time. Even if this place is just serving only prison food, I can’t help but see this as a… feast! Just then, I got a weird feeling of déjà vu. I knew I had seen a feast before… but where.
    “This is stab number one!” the old Grinchy Claus hissed as he threatened the inmates, shank in his fist. He grabbed a hostage, said he’d slice that bitch. But if OJ could do it, then so could the Grinch. Hostage in hand, he got out of jail. He then sent some letter bombs out in the mail. And he exacted revenge on some pompous ass jerks (The same people he swore to wipe off their smug smirks).
Day Twelve
    As I move from warehouse room to warehouse room, I start to wonder who made these warehouses. And why am I not allowed out? Maybe I’m part of some test. Or maybe I’m in here to keep me safe from the outside? Hmm… I never really considered that. Could this seemingly endless expanse of warehouse rooms be a safety mechanism to keep me from perishing in the outside world? I may never know.
    I wonder if the Warehouse is infinite… It sure seems like it has endless resources. It sure doesn’t seem like this could be real, but what do I know. I’m just a cog in this warehouse machine.
Day Thirteen
    I’ve been thinking more about the warehouse and I’ve come to the conclusion that maybe, just maybe, If I ever did manage to escape back into ordinary non-warehouse life, I might die from the sheer shock of being warehouse-free. I’m actually beginning to hope that this warehouse is never ending so that I don’t die from the sheer shock! So onwards I march, through the endless rooms.
    It isn’t all bad though. Today I went through a room that must have been giant. When I walked through the door, I was outside. Or at least, it seemed like I was outside. If it was a room, the walls must be insanely far away. I could see the sky and the horizon and mountains in the distance.
    I was in a golden field. The yellowish grasses were swaying in the breeze. The sun was setting over the horizon, casting a shadow across the landscape. I didn’t know what the point of it all was. I didn’t know who or what was making those places for me. And I didn’t know if and when the whole thing would come to an end. But at that moment, it didn’t matter.
    I sat. I watched. I closed my eyes and let the breeze engulf me in its freshness. The grass made such a relaxing sound as the wind pushed and pulled it. If only I could stay here indefinitely…
    But every happy dream eventually comes to and end just as the sun sets and leaves the landscape in shadows. Like the Sun, I too must be moving on.
	I found the door standing upright in the field. Any sane person would say the door was pointless. It couldn’t possibly serve a purpose standing alone in the middle of a field of golden grass atop a hill.The door could not separate an inside from an outside when there was no building around it. But the Warehouse works in mysterious ways. This, I have come to know. I opened the door and passed into another room.
Day Fourteen
    Passing through rooms, I met an odd man. He was the kind of man who you know is never telling you the whole truth.
    “Hello,” he said.
    “W- Who are you?” I replied.
    “You know me as the man in blue.”
    “Ok… but, I don’t know you at all.”
    “Oh, but you do. You just don’t see it yet,” he said, with a smirk on his face. It wasn’t a humorous smirk. It seemed forced. “But let’s not allow that to block our progress today. I’m here to get you out.” 
    “Out… of this warehouse? This prison that is my life?”
    “Yes,” said the man in blue. “So let’s get right down to it. Just watch me and do what I do.” At that, the man in blue brought his hand up to his head and put it through his head.
    That is… impossible. This must just be another trick. I took a step back. The man in blue started walking towards me.
    “Just cool down. What you’re seeing right now is a trick. This isn’t real.” he grabbed my forearm. “But it isn’t just me. My hand and my head aren’t the only things that are pretend. This whole place is a lie. None of it is real!” His head was only a few centimeters from mine. “Listen. I need you to concentrate. I need you to just relax and concentrate of putting your hand through your head. Just like I did.”
    “B-But,” I stammered, “That isn’t…”
    “This place isn’t real!” he said. “And I need you to feel that this place isn’t real. You need to feel that just like you felt with that door. Only this time, instead of the door you need your hand inside you.”
    My hands were shaking out of control. I didn’t know what I was doing. Nevertheless, my hand moved from my side, up to my head, and slowly closer to my face…
	Day Fifteen	
     I woke up on an old rust-colored fabric couch. I looked around the room I was in. I remembered bringing my hand up to my head, but after that, there are no memories.
    “How are you feeling?” said the man in blue, walking into the room with coffee in hand.4
    “Beyond awful,” I replied. “It’s like the worst hangover I’ve ever experienced.” I sat upright on the sofa and rubbed my temples. “Where am I? And where in the hell was I?”
    “You were in the warehouse. But you’re out now,” said the man in blue as he handed me a cup of coffee. “Drink up.”
    “Thanks.” I drank the hot beverage with vigor. “How did I get out of the warehouse exactly? And why did pushing my hand through my head get me out?”
    “People in the warehouse are in kind of a dream state. Very few ever realize they are in a dream state. When you forced your hand through your head, you became lucid and your brain rejected the false warehouse.”
    “So you’re saying that whole time I was in the warehouse, I was dreaming?”
    “More or less,” he said. “The warehouse is a type of sensory and perception control system. SPCS devices generate electromagnetic waves that interfere with your regular brain patters. These devices will immerse you in a virtual reality. And many never realize they are in one.
    “The user – or in your case the victim – is also put inside a small chamber called a life support pod. It handles all the human respiratory and digestive functions. This life support pod will takes care of the human physiologically while the SPCS controls the human psychologically.”
    “That is messed up,” I said. “Why in the hell was I in those pods? And who jammed me in there?”
    “Back in the last 2060’s,” the man in blue began, “We humans were far exceeding our population carrying capacity on Earth. As a result, the majority of nations on earth decided that for every baby born, there would be one human being put into the SPCS system.
    “This means that when people gave birth to a child, they had to either forfeit their child to the SPCS system, or go into the system themselves.”
    “But how would putting people into this SPCS system help the population issue?” I asked.
    “First of all it discourages some people from having children in the first place. Secondly, the amount of food and energy it takes to sustain someone in the SPCS machines is astoundingly minimal. If the entire human race decided to live in those machines, experts say we could pack trillions of people on this planet. The only problem is, the SPCS doesn’t interface so well with long-term memories. The system is notorious for stunting or even sometimes completely ruining people’s long-term memories. The bioelectrical engineers that designed the system have shown it to be a natural phenomenon of the electromagnetic waves interacting with the user’s brain.
    “So…” I started. “Is my long-term memory compromised?”
    “We can find out right now. The records show that you were put into the system at birth. That was 20 years ago. How long do you feel like you’ve been in the warehouse?”
    “… I feel like I’ve been in there for a week.”
    “I’m sorry,” he offered.
    I sat there in silence. I could hardly believe what I was hearing. I had existed and had been alive and dreaming for 20 years… And I could only remember the last week.
 Day Sixteen
	“If you have any more questions,” the man in blue said, “you can ask me.”
    “Thanks,” I said.
    “I’m going to make some breakfast,” the man in blue offered. “I’ll make enough for the both of us, so join me when you feel up to it.” He walked into another room I presumed to be the kitchen.
    I sat there on the rust-orange couch. I didn’t know what to think of this whole situation. Maybe that is a side effect of the SPCS system fucking up my brain… I can’t even formulate thoughts about my lack of memories. How ironically cruel it was.
    I brooded like this in silence for at least 5 minutes, although it felt longer than that. It was after those long five minutes that the man in blue called from the kitchen.
    “Breakfast is ready if you are hungry.”
    Until now, I hadn’t realized how hungry I was. So I got up and walked into the kitchen. The floor was linoleum. The walls were a warm, light-yellow color and the cabinets were made of cheap melamine. It seemed to be at least a few decades old. However, what really surprised me were the two cans of cat food sitting on the table. “Is that… cat food?” I asked, more than a little skeptical.
    “What? No.” he replied, taken aback.
    I looked down at the table, confirmed that it was wet, canned cat food, and looked up at him again. “You’re telling me that the food that smells like cat food, sitting in a can labeled ‘cat food’ isn’t cat food?”
    “We aren’t feeding it to any cats.”
    “It’s still cat food.”
    “It’s Fancy Feast.” He said.
    “But- uhg. That doesn’t matter. It’s cat food. And I don’t think I’m going to eat that.”
    The man in blue shrugged. “Suit yourself.” He reached across his table, grabbed the can of Fancy Feast that was prepared for me, and brought it back over to his side of the table. “Have a seat. I can make you some more tea or coffee if you’d like.”
    “That would be great,” I said. “I’ll take some tea, please.”
     He put the water pot on the stove and returned to the kitchen table. With his fork, the man in blue collected a generous amount of cat food, and put the food into his mouth. He chewed his cat food thoroughly, swallowed, and then washed it down with a sip of his coffee.
    “Surely I can’t be the first to tell you that is really strange.”
    “I don’t have a lot of company,” he said. “One day, my fridge was practically empty. The only thing I had left was a tin of cat food. I don’t even remember how it got in there. I have never owned a cat. But the supermarket was closed for the day and I was starving. Two years later, and just look at me now. I hardly pay anything for my food, my coat is thick and shiny, and my shopping list only has one item on it.”
    “Your… coat?” I asked.
    “Oh. I meant my hair. That cat food propaganda must be getting to me. I’m starting to think like one of them!” He raised one of his eyebrows while saying this, and subsequently downed a large forkful of cat food.
    The man in blue sat up, made my tea from the hot water, and served it to me.
    “Thanks.” I said.
    “Don’t mention it.” He replied as he sat back at his chair, starting on his second tin of cat food. He murmered something along the lines of, “Mmm… Seconds…”
    “I have one more question. How did you get me out of the warehouse? If the population limit is strictly kept, then why did the government allow you to let me out?”
    “Well, how I got you out is easy. When people die, they give a “life credit” to their next of kin. In that way, when a parent dies, their children are given a life credit. That credit allows the children to have children of their own. These credits can be gifted or even sold. I acquired a life credit a few years back. It was my uncle, and I was the closest blood relative. At first I didn’t know what to do with it, but I got to like the idea of bringing someone out of the SPCS – getting someone out of the warehouse. Someone like you.” He pointed his cat food covered fork at me and chewed his meal as he spoke.
	“You see, rarely are people let back out of the warehouse once they are put it. People know that there are problems with the system. Most people would consider what I did a waste of a perfectly good life credit – as it was being spent on bringing you, a piece of damaged merchandise, back out instead birthing a newborn baby.”
	“So they why did you do it?” I asked the man in blue. Although I half expected more nonsense from him at this point.
	He stopped eating and looked at me in a serious manor. “I know you think your mind is ruined, but trust me, it is far from it.”
	“In what way is my mind not subpar?” I asked him skeptically.
	“I’ve noticed a trend in… people who go into the warehouse for extended periods of time and then come back out. I’ve been researching this for years and have noticed some odd trends. Most people who have been in the SPCS for extended times come out mentally stunted. But a select few seem to be… how could I put it… well above the average. Some would call them borderline geniuses even.
	“I tried to find out what made these people different – what made them so elite? I’ve interviewed around a dozen people who have come back from the warehouse with superior intellect. I’ve interviewed hundreds of people who have come back stunted. I tried to find some set of data that correlated to the elite intelligence demonstrated by those people. You know what I found?”
	I sat there in silence.
The man in blue shifted in his chair, gave a slight smirk, and said, “The Grinch.”

    “What if we make a business that is like a casino?” I ask
    “Umm…” the man in blue said
    “Hear me out. We make our house into a gambling parlor. The only thing we change is this: the odds are 100% in our favor! That way, we can never loose capital!”
    “Well, first of all, gambling is illegal. Secondly, that isn’t gambling! What you just described is simply us taking people’s money!”
    “Well,” I started, “When you say it like that-”
    “It doesn’t matter how you phrase it, when the house has odds 100% in their favor, they are simply taking people’s money. That isn’t even gambling.”

2 Records show that the author’s only attempt at publishing “A Warehouse Diary” was uploading the story to a few websites.
3 Some historians believe it was intentionally removed from memory.
1 Some records suggest that it was in fact a “swe at shop” – not a sweat shop. This has been a point of discussion among Warehouse historians for a long time; there is consensus.
2 Some believe that the human was actually reflecting the book’s instructions without knowing it. Others have conjectured that it is possible the book and the human actually share the same mental state, and therefore neither is “copying” the other. If this were the case, then the book and the human would simply be two separate sides of the same coin.
3 The book labeled the day as “Day Twenty Thousand” when the human made that comment. Some historians take this as proof that the book and the human share the same mental state. Others think that the book was playing a joke on the human by labeling the day the same ridiculous number that the human thought up. Furthermore, they say that if the book is playing a joke on the human, than the book and the human couldn’t possibly share the same exact mental state. If the book and the human are really the same being, then it wouldn’t make sense for the book to be playing a joke on itself. This is widely disputed, and there is no agreed upon, absolute answer as of the time of this writing.
4 Coffee was a dark beverage that was traditionally served hot. The caffeine in this beverage made it a staple for the working class, but the popularity of the beverage was in no way restricted to any one demographic. However, you won’t find a restaurant that serves coffee anywhere today. This is due to Coffea Arabica – the tree necessary for the production of coffee beans – going extinct in the late 2100’s.
