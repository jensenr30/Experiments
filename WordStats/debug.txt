      2 - ONE
      3 - Arthur
      4 - fell
      5 - The
      6 - air
      7 - rushed
      8 - past
      9 - him
     10 - stinging
     11 - his
     12 - eyes
     13 - and
     14 - ripping
     15 - at
     16 - his
     17 - hair
     18 - and
     19 - clothes
     20 - He
     21 - had
     22 - already
     23 - fallen
     24 - through
     25 - the
     26 - hole
     27 - made
     28 - by
     29 - Saturday‘s
     30 - assault
     31 - ram
     32 - past
     33 - the
     34 - grasping
     35 - roots
     36 - and
     37 - tendrils
     38 - of
     39 - the
     40 - underside
     41 - of
     42 - the
     43 - Incomparable
     44 - Gardens
     45 - Now
     46 - he
     47 - was
     48 - plummeting
     49 - through
     50 - the
     51 - clouds
     52 - and
     53 - a
     54 - small
     55 - part
     56 - of
     57 - him
     58 - knew
     59 - that
     60 - if
     61 - he
     62 - didn‘t
     63 - do
     64 - something
     65 - really
     66 - soon
     67 - he
     68 - was
     69 - going
     70 - to
     71 - smash
     72 - into
     73 - Saturday‘s
     74 - tower
     75 - and
     76 - in
     77 - all
     78 - likelihood
     79 - be
     80 - so
     81 - badly
     82 - broken
     83 - that
     84 - even
     85 - with
     86 - his
     87 - newly
     88 - reshaped
     89 - Denizen
     90 - body
     91 - he
     92 - would
     93 - die
     94 - –
     95 - or
     96 - wish
     97 - he
     98 - was
     99 - dead
    100 - But
    101 - Arthur
    102 - didn‘t
    103 - do
    104 - anything
    105 - at
    106 - least
    107 - not
    108 - in
    109 - those
    110 - first
    111 - few
    112 - vital
    113 - seconds
    114 - He
    115 - knew
    116 - it
    117 - was
    118 - an
    119 - illusion
    120 - but
    121 - it
    122 - felt
    123 - like
    124 - the
    125 - wind
    126 - was
    127 - holding
    128 - him
    129 - up
    130 - rather
    131 - than
    132 - rushing
    133 - past
    134 - In
    135 - his
    136 - left
    137 - hand
    138 - he
    139 - held
    140 - the
    141 - small
    142 - mirror
    143 - that
    144 - was
    145 - the
    146 - Fifth
    147 - Key
    148 - and
    149 - in
    150 - his
    151 - right
    152 - he
    153 - clutched
    154 - the
    155 - quill
    156 - pen
    157 - that
    158 - was
    159 - the
    160 - Sixth
    161 - Key
    162 - which
    163 - he
    164 - had
    165 - wrested
    166 - from
    167 - Saturday
    168 - and
    169 - taken
    170 - with
    171 - him
    172 - over
    173 - the
    174 - edge
    175 - Because
    176 - of
    177 - this
    178 - Arthur
    179 - felt
    180 - powerful
    181 - triumphant
    182 - and
    183 - not
    184 - at
    185 - all
    186 - afraid
    187 - He
    188 - looked
    189 - down
    190 - at
    191 - the
    192 - tower
    193 - below
    194 - him
    195 - and
    196 - laughed
    197 - –
    198 - a
    199 - deep
    200 - sarcastic
    201 - laugh
    202 - that
    203 - was
    204 - not
    205 - at
    206 - all
    207 - like
    208 - his
    209 - normal
    210 - laughter
    211 - He
    212 - was
    213 - about
    214 - to
    215 - laugh
    216 - again
    217 - when
    218 - Part
    219 - Six
    220 - of
    221 - the
    222 - Will
    223 - in
    224 - its
    225 - raven
    226 - form
    227 - caught
    228 - up
    229 - with
    230 - him
    231 - its
    232 - claws
    233 - latching
    234 - on
    235 - to
    236 - his
    237 - hair
    238 - and
    239 - digging
    240 - into
    241 - his
    242 - scalp
    243 - Wings
    244 - ”
    245 - croaked
    246 - the
    247 - raven
    248 - urgently
    249 - It
    250 - hung
    251 - on
    252 - to
    253 - his
    254 - head
    255 - for
    256 - a
    257 - second
    258 - then
    259 - lost
    260 - its
    261 - grip
    262 - and
    263 - spun
    264 - off
    265 - calling
    266 - out
    267 - Fly
    268 - Fly
    269 - ”
    270 - as
    271 - it
    272 - tried
    273 - desperately
    274 - to
    275 - keep
    276 - up
    277 - Instantly
    278 - Arthur
    279 - lost
    280 - his
    281 - sense
    282 - of
    283 - euphoric
    284 - invincibility
    285 - and
    286 - came
    287 - back
    288 - to
    289 - his
    290 - senses
    291 - He
    292 - properly
    293 - took
    294 - in
    295 - the
    296 - speed
    297 - of
    298 - his
    299 - descent
    300 - for
    301 - the
    302 - first
    303 - time
    304 - and
    305 - saw
    306 - that
    307 - he
    308 - was
    309 - going
    310 - to
    311 - hit
    312 - the
    313 - tower
    314 - very
    315 - very
    316 - soon
    317 - This
    318 - is
    319 - all
    320 - wrong
    321 - he
    322 - thought
    323 - Where
    324 - are
    325 - my
    326 - wings
    327 - He
    328 - frantically
    329 - searched
    330 - his
    331 - coat
    332 - even
    333 - as
    334 - he
    335 - remembered
    336 - that
    337 - his
    338 - grease
    339 - monkey
    340 - wings
    341 - were
    342 - still
    343 - in
    344 - the
    345 - rain
    346 - mantle
    347 - that
    348 - he‘d
    349 - exchanged
    350 - for
    351 - his
    352 - current
    353 - disguise
    354 - as
    355 - a
    356 - Sorcerous
    357 - Supernumerary
    358 - –
    359 - the
    360 - disguise
    361 - he‘d
    362 - used
    363 - to
    364 - infiltrate
    365 - the
    366 - assault
    367 - ram…too
    368 - successfully
    369 - perhaps
    370 - for
    371 - he‘d
    372 - gone
    373 - with
    374 - the
    375 - ram
    376 - when
    377 - it
    378 - broke
    379 - through
    380 - into
    381 - the
    382 - Incomparable
    383 - Gardens
    384 - While
    385 - he
    386 - had
    387 - then
    388 - got
    389 - close
    390 - enough
    391 - to
    392 - Superior
    393 - Saturday
    394 - to
    395 - claim
    396 - the
    397 - Sixth
    398 - Key
    399 - he‘d
    400 - fallen
    401 - back
    402 - through
    403 - the
    404 - hole
    405 - in
    406 - the
    407 - ceiling
    408 - of
    409 - the
    410 - Upper
    411 - House
    412 - Now
    413 - he
    414 - was
    415 - falling
    416 - a
    417 - very
    418 - very
    419 - long
    420 - way
    421 - down
    422 - Even
    423 - starting
    424 - from
    425 - such
    426 - a
    427 - height
    428 - Arthur
    429 - had
    430 - fallen
    431 - far
    432 - faster
    433 - than
    434 - he‘d
    435 - thought
    436 - possible
    437 - He
    438 - was
    439 - going
    440 - to
    441 - miss
    442 - the
    443 - actual
    444 - peak
    445 - he
    446 - saw
    447 - and
    448 - crash
    449 - into
    450 - the
    451 - main
    452 - part
    453 - some
    454 - fifteen
    455 - levels
    456 - below
    457 - No
    458 - wings
    459 - thought
    460 - Arthur
    461 - No
    462 - wings
    463 - His
    464 - mind
    465 - halted
    466 - in
    467 - panic
    468 - and
    469 - all
    470 - he
    471 - could
    472 - do
    473 - was
    474 - stare
    475 - at
    476 - the
    477 - tower
    478 - tears
    479 - streaming
    480 - from
    481 - his
    482 - eyes
    483 - because
    484 - the
    485 - wind
    486 - was
    487 - rushing
    488 - by
    489 - so
    490 - fast
    491 - He
    492 - found
    493 - himself
    494 - flapping
    495 - his
    496 - arms
    497 - as
    498 - if
    499 - somehow
    500 - that
    501 - might
    502 - help
    503 - and
    504 - he
    505 - was
    506 - screaming
    507 - and
    508 - then—
    509 - He
    510 - crashed
    511 - into
    512 - a
    513 - flying
    514 - Internal
    515 - Auditor
    516 - who
    517 - screamed
    518 - as
    519 - well
    520 - Together
    521 - they
    522 - tumbled
    523 - through
    524 - the
    525 - air
    526 - the
    527 - Denizen‘s
    528 - wings
    529 - thrashing
    530 - wildly
    531 - Arthur
    532 - tried
    533 - to
    534 - rip
    535 - the
    536 - wings
    537 - from
    538 - the
    539 - Auditor
    540 - but
    541 - he
    542 - didn‘t
    543 - want
    544 - to
    545 - let
    546 - go
    547 - of
    548 - the
    549 - Fifth
    550 - and
    551 - Sixth
    552 - Keys
    553 - so
    554 - he
    555 - couldn‘t
    556 - get
    557 - a
    558 - proper
    559 - grip
    560 - He
    561 - tried
    562 - to
    563 - transfer
    564 - the
    565 - Sixth
    566 - Key
    567 - so
    568 - as
    569 - to
    570 - hold
    571 - both
    572 - Keys
    573 - in
    574 - his
    575 - left
    576 - hand
    577 - but
    578 - in
    579 - that
    580 - vital
    581 - moment
    582 - the
    583 - Denizen
    584 - kicked
    585 - free
    586 - and
    587 - dived
    588 - away
    589 - his
    590 - wings
    591 - folded
    592 - back
    593 - Arthur
    594 - fell
    595 - again
    596 - but
    597 - the
    598 - collision
    599 - had
    600 - checked
    601 - his
    602 - speed
    603 - He
    604 - had
    605 - a
    606 - few
    607 - seconds
    608 - to
    609 - take
    610 - action
    611 - and
    612 - his
    613 - brain
    614 - finally
    615 - got
    616 - back
    617 - to
    618 - work
    619 - on
    620 - problem-solving
    621 - instead
    622 - of
    623 - gloating
    624 - over
    625 - the
    626 - Sixth
    627 - Key
    628 - or
    629 - cowering
    630 - in
    631 - fear
    632 - He
    633 - knew
    634 - there
    635 - was
    636 - no
    637 - way
    638 - to
    639 - avoid
    640 - colliding
    641 - with
    642 - the
    643 - tower
    644 - –
    645 - unless
    646 - he
    647 - never
    648 - actually
    649 - arrived
    650 - there…
    651 - A
    652 - hundred
    653 - feet
    654 - from
    655 - impact
    656 - Arthur
    657 - somersaulted
    658 - into
    659 - a
    660 - swan
    661 - dive
    662 - Stretching
    663 - his
    664 - arms
    665 - out
    666 - below
    667 - his
    668 - body
    669 - he
    670 - drew
    671 - several
    672 - steps
    673 - in
    674 - the
    675 - air
    676 - with
    677 - the
    678 - Sixth
    679 - Key
    680 - The
    681 - pen
    682 - left
    683 - glowing
    684 - trails
    685 - of
    686 - light
    687 - which
    688 - instantly
    689 - took
    690 - on
    691 - the
    692 - appearance
    693 - of
    694 - solid
    695 - white
    696 - marble
    697 - steps
    698 - Arthur
    699 - hit
    700 - hard
    701 - immediately
    702 - tucking
    703 - himself
    704 - into
    705 - a
    706 - ball
    707 - to
    708 - roll
    709 - down
    710 - the
    711 - Improbable
    712 - Stair
    713 - As
    714 - he
    715 - bounced
    716 - and
    717 - tumbled
    718 - over
    719 - each
    720 - step
    721 - he
    722 - knew
    723 - he
    724 - had
    725 - to
    726 - get
    727 - his
    728 - speed
    729 - under
    730 - control
    731 - Even
    732 - when
    733 - he
    734 - stuck
    735 - out
    736 - his
    737 - leg
    738 - he
    739 - only
    740 - tumbled
    741 - sideways
    742 - –
    743 - and
    744 - kept
    745 - falling
    746 - Climbing
    747 - up
    748 - the
    749 - Improbable
    750 - Stair
    751 - was
    752 - bad
    753 - enough
    754 - with
    755 - the
    756 - chance
    757 - of
    758 - coming
    759 - out
    760 - on
    761 - some
    762 - random
    763 - Landing
    764 - anywhere
    765 - in
    766 - time
    767 - or
    768 - space
    769 - Falling
    770 - down
    771 - it
    772 - –
    773 - completely
    774 - out
    775 - of
    776 - control
    777 - –
    778 - was
    779 - even
    780 - worse
    781 - Arthur
    782 - remembered
    783 - the
    784 - Old
    785 - One‘s
    786 - caution
    787 - the
    788 - words
    789 - now
    790 - echoing
    791 - inside
    792 - his
    793 - head
    794 - in
    795 - between
    796 - thuds
    797 - bangs
    798 - and
    799 - the
    800 - jangling
    801 - pain
    802 - of
    803 - new
    804 - bruises
    805 - It
    806 - is
    807 - possible
    808 - to
    809 - end
    810 - up
    811 - somewhere
    812 - you
    813 - particularly
    814 - do
    815 - not
    816 - wish
    817 - to
    818 - be
    819 - the
    820 - Old
    821 - One
    822 - had
    823 - said
    824 - It
    825 - is
    826 - even
    827 - likely
    828 - for
    829 - that
    830 - is
    831 - part
    832 - of
    833 - the
    834 - Stair‘s
    835 - nature
    836 - He
    837 - tried
    838 - again
    839 - to
    840 - stop
    841 - but
    842 - since
    843 - he
    844 - was
    845 - still
    846 - clutching
    847 - the
    848 - Keys
    849 - he
    850 - couldn‘t
    851 - even
    852 - grab
    853 - on
    854 - to
    855 - the
    856 - edge
    857 - of
    858 - a
    859 - step
    860 - It
    861 - was
    862 - more
    863 - like
    864 - falling
    865 - down
    866 - a
    867 - slide
    868 - than
    869 - a
    870 - staircase
    871 - much
    872 - more
    873 - so
    874 - than
    875 - could
    876 - be
    877 - normal
    878 - or
    879 - natural
    880 - The
    881 - Stair
    882 - itself
    883 - was
    884 - working
    885 - against
    886 - him
    887 - accelerating
    888 - his
    889 - fall
    890 - leading
    891 - him
    892 - somewhere
    893 - he
    894 - doubted
    895 - he‘d
    896 - want
    897 - to
    898 - be
    899 - Thoughts
    900 - of
    901 - really
    902 - terrible
    903 - places
    904 - in
    905 - history
    906 - began
    907 - to
    908 - flash
    909 - through
    910 - Arthur‘s
    911 - mind
    912 - thoughts
    913 - made
    914 - more
    915 - awful
    916 - because
    917 - he
    918 - knew
    919 - that
    920 - if
    921 - he
    922 - focused
    923 - on
    924 - any
    925 - one
    926 - place
    927 - for
    928 - too
    929 - long
    930 - the
    931 - Stair
    932 - would
    933 - take
    934 - him
    935 - there
    936 - He
    937 - tried
    938 - to
    939 - turn
    940 - on
    941 - his
    942 - stomach
    943 - and
    944 - stop
    945 - the
    946 - endless
    947 - slide
    948 - with
    949 - his
    950 - elbows
    951 - but
    952 - this
    953 - didn‘t
    954 - work
    955 - either
    956 - though
    957 - it
    958 - hurt
    959 - a
    960 - lot
    961 - Arthur
    962 - grimaced
    963 - as
    964 - his
    965 - funny
    966 - bones
    967 - were
    968 - repeatedly
    969 - jarred
    970 - Before
    971 - his
    972 - transformation
    973 - from
    974 - a
    975 - mortal
    976 - boy
    977 - into
    978 - a
    979 - Denizen
    980 - or
    981 - whatever
    982 - he
    983 - had
    984 - become
    985 - he
    986 - would
    987 - have
    988 - been
    989 - screaming
    990 - with
    991 - pain
    992 - and
    993 - his
    994 - arms
    995 - would
    996 - have
    997 - broken
    998 - like
    999 - sticks
   1000 - But
   1001 - the
   1002 - Keys
   1003 - and
   1004 - his
   1005 - use
   1006 - of
   1007 - them
   1008 - had
   1009 - changed
   1010 - his
   1011 - bones
   1012 - skin
   1013 - and
   1014 - blood
   1015 - beyond
   1016 - anything
   1017 - a
   1018 - doctor
   1019 - would
   1020 - recognise
   1021 - as
   1022 - human
   1023 - Arthur
   1024 - was
   1025 - afraid
   1026 - there
   1027 - were
   1028 - other
   1029 - changes
   1030 - too
   1031 - changes
   1032 - inside
   1033 - him
   1034 - that
   1035 - removed
   1036 - him
   1037 - even
   1038 - further
   1039 - from
   1040 - humanity
   1041 - things
   1042 - that
   1043 - went
   1044 - beyond
   1045 - his
   1046 - new
   1047 - size
   1048 - strength
   1049 - and
   1050 - durability
   1051 - But
   1052 - this
   1053 - was
   1054 - a
   1055 - distant
   1056 - nagging
   1057 - fear
   1058 - that
   1059 - was
   1060 - currently
   1061 - overwhelmed
   1062 - by
   1063 - his
   1064 - current
   1065 - panic
   1066 - I
   1067 - have
   1068 - to
   1069 - stop
   1070 - he
   1071 - thought
   1072 - I
   1073 - have
   1074 - to
   1075 - get
   1076 - off
   1077 - the
   1078 - Stair
   1079 - He
   1080 - rolled
   1081 - on
   1082 - to
   1083 - his
   1084 - back
   1085 - gasping
   1086 - as
   1087 - the
   1088 - front
   1089 - edge
   1090 - of
   1091 - each
   1092 - step
   1093 - smacked
   1094 - him
   1095 - in
   1096 - the
   1097 - backbone
   1098 - He
   1099 - put
   1100 - the
   1101 - Sixth
   1102 - Key
   1103 - in
   1104 - his
   1105 - mouth
   1106 - so
   1107 - he
   1108 - would
   1109 - have
   1110 - a
   1111 - hand
   1112 - free
   1113 - Then
   1114 - he
   1115 - raised
   1116 - the
   1117 - mirror
   1118 - of
   1119 - the
   1120 - Fifth
   1121 - Key
   1122 - held
   1123 - it
   1124 - in
   1125 - front
   1126 - of
   1127 - his
   1128 - face
   1129 - and
   1130 - tried
   1131 - to
   1132 - focus
   1133 - on
   1134 - it
   1135 - as
   1136 - he
   1137 - continued
   1138 - his
   1139 - juddering
   1140 - descent
   1141 - The
   1142 - mirror
   1143 - had
   1144 - been
   1145 - blocked
   1146 - by
   1147 - Saturday‘s
   1148 - sorcerers
   1149 - inside
   1150 - the
   1151 - Upper
   1152 - House
   1153 - and
   1154 - it
   1155 - might
   1156 - not
   1157 - work
   1158 - inside
   1159 - the
   1160 - Stair
   1161 - either
   1162 - but
   1163 - Arthur
   1164 - had
   1165 - to
   1166 - take
   1167 - any
   1168 - chance
   1169 - he
   1170 - could
   1171 - to
   1172 - get
   1173 - out
   1174 - First
   1175 - though
   1176 - he
   1177 - had
   1178 - to
   1179 - find
   1180 - a
   1181 - way
   1182 - to
   1183 - hold
   1184 - the
   1185 - mirror
   1186 - steady
   1187 - and
   1188 - he
   1189 - had
   1190 - to
   1191 - keep
   1192 - the
   1193 - picture
   1194 - of
   1195 - Sir
   1196 - Thursday‘s
   1197 - bedroom
   1198 - in
   1199 - his
   1200 - head
   1201 - This
   1202 - was
   1203 - very
   1204 - hard
   1205 - to
   1206 - do
   1207 - He
   1208 - tried
   1209 - to
   1210 - visualize
   1211 - it
   1212 - but
   1213 - he
   1214 - kept
   1215 - thinking
   1216 - of
   1217 - places
   1218 - he
   1219 - didn‘t
   1220 - want
   1221 - to
   1222 - go
   1223 - like
   1224 - the
   1225 - plague-ridden
   1226 - London
   1227 - of
   1228 - Suzy
   1229 - Turquoise
   1230 - Blue‘s
   1231 - time
   1232 - or
   1233 - the
   1234 - island
   1235 - in
   1236 - the
   1237 - middle
   1238 - of
   1239 - a
   1240 - sun
   1241 - where
   1242 - he‘d
   1243 - found
   1244 - Part
   1245 - Two
   1246 - of
   1247 - the
   1248 - Will
   1249 - Even
   1250 - as
   1251 - a
   1252 - Denizen
   1253 - Arthur
   1254 - knew
   1255 - he
   1256 - couldn‘t
   1257 - survive
   1258 - if
   1259 - he
   1260 - came
   1261 - out
   1262 - of
   1263 - the
   1264 - Stair
   1265 - into
   1266 - the
   1267 - heart
   1268 - of
   1269 - a
   1270 - star
   1271 - He
   1272 - also
   1273 - wouldn‘t
   1274 - survive
   1275 - an
   1276 - emergence
   1277 - into
   1278 - Nothing
   1279 - Which
   1280 - meant
   1281 - he
   1282 - also
   1283 - had
   1284 - to
   1285 - stop
   1286 - thinking
   1287 - about
   1288 - Doorstop
   1289 - Hill
   1290 - or
   1291 - any
   1292 - parts
   1293 - of
   1294 - the
   1295 - House
   1296 - that
   1297 - he
   1298 - knew
   1299 - had
   1300 - already
   1301 - been
   1302 - consumed
   1303 - by
   1304 - Nothing
   1305 - So
   1306 - much
   1307 - of
   1308 - it
   1309 - was
   1310 - gone
   1311 - already
   1312 - as
   1313 - the
   1314 - Void
   1315 - spread
   1316 - into
   1317 - the
   1318 - House
   1319 - destroying
   1320 - everything
   1321 - in
   1322 - its
   1323 - path
   1324 - Arthur
   1325 - shivered
   1326 - inside
   1327 - as
   1328 - he
   1329 - remembered
   1330 - the
   1331 - great
   1332 - wave
   1333 - of
   1334 - Nothing
   1335 - that
   1336 - he
   1337 - had
   1338 - fled
   1339 - a
   1340 - moment
   1341 - before
   1342 - it
   1343 - destroyed
   1344 - Monday‘s
   1345 - Dayroom—
   1346 - No
   1347 - Arthur
   1348 - yelled
   1349 - to
   1350 - himself
   1351 - Think
   1352 - of
   1353 - somewhere
   1354 - safe
   1355 - Somewhere
   1356 - easy
   1357 - Home
   1358 - But
   1359 - even
   1360 - home
   1361 - might
   1362 - not
   1363 - be
   1364 - safe
   1365 - –
   1366 - I‘ve
   1367 - got
   1368 - to
   1369 - just
   1370 - stop
   1371 - and
   1372 - think—
   1373 - But
   1374 - he
   1375 - couldn‘t
   1376 - steady
   1377 - the
   1378 - mirror
   1379 - or
   1380 - get
   1381 - his
   1382 - mind
   1383 - to
   1384 - focus
   1385 - on
   1386 - somewhere
   1387 - safe
   1388 - Instead
   1389 - he
   1390 - rolled
   1391 - over
   1392 - again
   1393 - and
   1394 - grabbed
   1395 - at
   1396 - the
   1397 - next
   1398 - step
   1399 - with
   1400 - his
   1401 - free
   1402 - hand
   1403 - his
   1404 - fingernails
   1405 - raking
   1406 - across
   1407 - the
   1408 - marble
   1409 - down
   1410 - one…two…three
   1411 - steps
   1412 - His
   1413 - arm
   1414 - almost
   1415 - came
   1416 - out
   1417 - of
   1418 - its
   1419 - shoulder
   1420 - socket
   1421 - as
   1422 - his
   1423 - slide
   1424 - was
   1425 - arrested
   1426 - and
   1427 - he
   1428 - nearly
   1429 - dropped
   1430 - the
   1431 - Sixth
   1432 - Key
   1433 - when
   1434 - he
   1435 - couldn‘t
   1436 - help
   1437 - but
   1438 - groan
   1439 - at
   1440 - this
   1441 - new
   1442 - and
   1443 - sudden
   1444 - pain
   1445 - But
   1446 - he
   1447 - stopped
   1448 - Arthur
   1449 - sighed
   1450 - and
   1451 - dropped
   1452 - the
   1453 - Sixth
   1454 - Key
   1455 - from
   1456 - his
   1457 - mouth
   1458 - to
   1459 - his
   1460 - bloodied
   1461 - hand
   1462 - He
   1463 - slowly
   1464 - stood
   1465 - and
   1466 - set
   1467 - his
   1468 - foot
   1469 - on
   1470 - the
   1471 - next
   1472 - step
   1473 - It
   1474 - was
   1475 - time
   1476 - to
   1477 - start
   1478 - climbing
   1479 - back
   1480 - up
   1481 - while
   1482 - thinking
   1483 - hard
   1484 - about
   1485 - where
   1486 - to
   1487 - come
   1488 - out
   1489 - He
   1490 - was
   1491 - just
   1492 - about
   1493 - to
   1494 - start
   1495 - doing
   1496 - this
   1497 - when
   1498 - the
   1499 - Stair
   1500 - disappeared
   1501 - in
   1502 - a
   1503 - flash
   1504 - of
   1505 - bright
   1506 - white
   1507 - light
   1508 - Arthur‘s
   1509 - foot
   1510 - met
   1511 - no
   1512 - resistance
   1513 - He
   1514 - fell
   1515 - forward
   1516 - into
   1517 - a
   1518 - hole
   1519 - full
   1520 - of
   1521 - evil-smelling
   1522 - mud
   1523 - The
   1524 - Stair
   1525 - as
   1526 - it
   1527 - always
   1528 - tried
   1529 - to
   1530 - do
   1531 - had
   1532 - thrown
   1533 - him
   1534 - out
   1535 - on
   1536 - to
   1537 - some
   1538 - random
   1539 - Landing
   1540 - which
   1541 - could
   1542 - be
   1543 - anywhere
   1544 - in
   1545 - the
   1546 - Secondary
   1547 - Realms
   1548 - and
   1549 - could
   1550 - also
   1551 - be
   1552 - at
   1553 - any
   1554 - time
   1555 - in
   1556 - the
   1557 - past
   1558 - Arthur
   1559 - almost
   1560 - went
   1561 - face-first
   1562 - into
   1563 - the
   1564 - mud
   1565 - but
   1566 - he
   1567 - recovered
   1568 - his
   1569 - balance
   1570 - in
   1571 - just
   1572 - enough
   1573 - time
   1574 - to
   1575 - stagger
   1576 - forward
   1577 - and
   1578 - crash
   1579 - into
   1580 - a
   1581 - sandbagged
   1582 - earth
   1583 - wall
   1584 - instead
   1585 - He
   1586 - bounced
   1587 - off
   1588 - that
   1589 - went
   1590 - back
   1591 - into
   1592 - the
   1593 - hole
   1594 - and
   1595 - windmilled
   1596 - his
   1597 - arms
   1598 - desperately
   1599 - for
   1600 - a
   1601 - second
   1602 - before
   1603 - ending
   1604 - up
   1605 - planted
   1606 - backside-first
   1607 - in
   1608 - about
   1609 - a
   1610 - foot
   1611 - of
   1612 - yellow
   1613 - stinking
   1614 - mud
   1615 - He
   1616 - sat
   1617 - there
   1618 - long
   1619 - enough
   1620 - to
   1621 - make
   1622 - a
   1623 - face
   1624 - then
   1625 - slowly
   1626 - got
   1627 - back
   1628 - to
   1629 - his
   1630 - feet
   1631 - the
   1632 - mud
   1633 - making
   1634 - a
   1635 - popping
   1636 - sound
   1637 - as
   1638 - he
   1639 - rose
   1640 - There
   1641 - were
   1642 - other
   1643 - stranger
   1644 - noises
   1645 - too
   1646 - distant
   1647 - high-pitched
   1648 - electronic
   1649 - squeals
   1650 - that
   1651 - hurt
   1652 - his
   1653 - ears
   1654 - Arthur
   1655 - looked
   1656 - around
   1657 - For
   1658 - a
   1659 - moment
   1660 - he
   1661 - thought
   1662 - he‘d
   1663 - come
   1664 - out
   1665 - in
   1666 - a
   1667 - World
   1668 - War
   1669 - One
   1670 - trench
   1671 - back
   1672 - in
   1673 - the
   1674 - history
   1675 - of
   1676 - his
   1677 - own
   1678 - Earth
   1679 - But
   1680 - that
   1681 - thought
   1682 - only
   1683 - lasted
   1684 - for
   1685 - a
   1686 - moment
   1687 - He
   1688 - was
   1689 - in
   1690 - a
   1691 - trench
   1692 - all
   1693 - right
   1694 - but
   1695 - the
   1696 - mud
   1697 - was
   1698 - a
   1699 - lurid
   1700 - unearthly
   1701 - yellow
   1702 - and
   1703 - stank
   1704 - of
   1705 - sulphur
   1706 - The
   1707 - sandbags
   1708 - now
   1709 - that
   1710 - he
   1711 - looked
   1712 - at
   1713 - them
   1714 - properly
   1715 - were
   1716 - pale
   1717 - blue
   1718 - He
   1719 - tapped
   1720 - one
   1721 - and
   1722 - his
   1723 - knuckles
   1724 - sank
   1725 - in
   1726 - a
   1727 - little
   1728 - bit
   1729 - and
   1730 - then
   1731 - bounced
   1732 - back
   1733 - Foam
   1734 - thought
   1735 - Arthur
   1736 - The
   1737 - sandbags
   1738 - are
   1739 - filled
   1740 - with
   1741 - something
   1742 - like
   1743 - packing
   1744 - foam
   1745 - The
   1746 - zinging
   1747 - noises
   1748 - were
   1749 - getting
   1750 - closer
   1751 - Arthur
   1752 - didn‘t
   1753 - know
   1754 - what
   1755 - was
   1756 - making
   1757 - them
   1758 - and
   1759 - he
   1760 - had
   1761 - no
   1762 - intention
   1763 - of
   1764 - hanging
   1765 - around
   1766 - to
   1767 - find
   1768 - out
   1769 - The
   1770 - only
   1771 - question
   1772 - was
   1773 - whether
   1774 - the
   1775 - Fifth
   1776 - Key
   1777 - would
   1778 - work
   1779 - if
   1780 - the
   1781 - Improbable
   1782 - Stair
   1783 - had
   1784 - dumped
   1785 - him
   1786 - off
   1787 - somewhere
   1788 - back
   1789 - in
   1790 - time
   1791 - as
   1792 - well
   1793 - as
   1794 - into
   1795 - the
   1796 - Secondary
   1797 - Realms
   1798 - If
   1799 - he
   1800 - couldn‘t
   1801 - use
   1802 - the
   1803 - mirror
   1804 - he‘d
   1805 - have
   1806 - to
   1807 - use
   1808 - the
   1809 - Stair
   1810 - and
   1811 - that
   1812 - meant
   1813 - getting
   1814 - back
   1815 - on
   1816 - to
   1817 - it
   1818 - as
   1819 - quickly
   1820 - as
   1821 - possible
   1822 - Theoretically
   1823 - as
   1824 - he
   1825 - had
   1826 - two
   1827 - Keys
   1828 - he
   1829 - could
   1830 - enter
   1831 - the
   1832 - Improbable
   1833 - Stair
   1834 - pretty
   1835 - much
   1836 - anywhere
   1837 - but
   1838 - he
   1839 - knew
   1840 - in
   1841 - practice
   1842 - it
   1843 - was
   1844 - bound
   1845 - to
   1846 - be
   1847 - more
   1848 - difficult
   1849 - and
   1850 - there
   1851 - was
   1852 - a
   1853 - very
   1854 - good
   1855 - chance
   1856 - that
   1857 - his
   1858 - next
   1859 - trip
   1860 - on
   1861 - the
   1862 - Stair
   1863 - would
   1864 - take
   1865 - him
   1866 - somewhere
   1867 - worse
   1868 - than
   1869 - this
   1870 - Quickly
   1871 - he
   1872 - put
   1873 - the
   1874 - quill
   1875 - pen
   1876 - inside
   1877 - his
   1878 - silver
   1879 - bag
   1880 - along
   1881 - with
   1882 - his
   1883 - yellow
   1884 - elephant
   1885 - and
   1886 - the
   1887 - medallion
   1888 - he‘d
   1889 - been
   1890 - given
   1891 - by
   1892 - the
   1893 - Mariner
   1894 - Then
   1895 - he
   1896 - replaced
   1897 - the
   1898 - bag
   1899 - safely
   1900 - inside
   1901 - the
   1902 - pouch
   1903 - of
   1904 - his
   1905 - utility
   1906 - belt
   1907 - He
   1908 - kept
   1909 - the
   1910 - Sorcerous
   1911 - Supernumerary‘s
   1912 - large
   1913 - coat
   1914 - on
   1915 - over
   1916 - the
   1917 - top
   1918 - of
   1919 - his
   1920 - coveralls
   1921 - Even
   1922 - though
   1923 - the
   1924 - yellow
   1925 - mud
   1926 - looked
   1927 - like
   1928 - it
   1929 - was
   1930 - boiling
   1931 - it
   1932 - felt
   1933 - cold
   1934 - –
   1935 - and
   1936 - if
   1937 - Arthur
   1938 - felt
   1939 - it
   1940 - that
   1941 - meant
   1942 - it
   1943 - was
   1944 - very
   1945 - cold
   1946 - indeed
   1947 - This
   1948 - was
   1949 - confirmed
   1950 - by
   1951 - his
   1952 - breath
   1953 - which
   1954 - wasn‘t
   1955 - just
   1956 - fogging
   1957 - out
   1958 - it
   1959 - was
   1960 - freezing
   1961 - in
   1962 - the
   1963 - air
   1964 - In
   1965 - only
   1966 - a
   1967 - few
   1968 - minutes
   1969 - he
   1970 - developed
   1971 - a
   1972 - long
   1973 - thin
   1974 - beard
   1975 - of
   1976 - ice
   1977 - crystals
   1978 - that
   1979 - sparkled
   1980 - from
   1981 - his
   1982 - chin
   1983 - down
   1984 - to
   1985 - his
   1986 - chest
   1987 - The
   1988 - sunlight
   1989 - though
   1990 - very
   1991 - bright
   1992 - was
   1993 - more
   1994 - red
   1995 - than
   1996 - yellow
   1997 - and
   1998 - he
   1999 - could
   2000 - feel
   2001 - no
   2002 - noticeable
   2003 - heat
   2004 - from
   2005 - it
   2006 - on
   2007 - his
   2008 - face
   2009 - or
   2010 - hands
   2011 - Wherever
   2012 - he
   2013 - was
   2014 - it
   2015 - wasn‘t
   2016 - Earth
   2017 - and
   2018 - Arthur
   2019 - suspected
   2020 - it
   2021 - wasn‘t
   2022 - somewhere
   2023 - a
   2024 - normal
   2025 - human
   2026 - could
   2027 - survive
   2028 - for
   2029 - a
   2030 - second
   2031 - He
   2032 - was
   2033 - thankful
   2034 - that
   2035 - he
   2036 - could
   2037 - but
   2038 - it
   2039 - also
   2040 - sent
   2041 - a
   2042 - pang
   2043 - through
   2044 - him
   2045 - another
   2046 - reminder
   2047 - of
   2048 - what
   2049 - he
   2050 - had
   2051 - become
   2052 - and
   2053 - what
   2054 - he
   2055 - no
   2056 - longer
   2057 - was
   2058 - He
   2059 - raised
   2060 - the
   2061 - mirror
   2062 - and
   2063 - was
   2064 - about
   2065 - to
   2066 - visualize
   2067 - Sir
   2068 - Thursday‘s
   2069 - chamber
   2070 - when
   2071 - he
   2072 - glimpsed
   2073 - a
   2074 - reflection
   2075 - from
   2076 - behind
   2077 - him
   2078 - He
   2079 - spun
   2080 - round
   2081 - just
   2082 - as
   2083 - something
   2084 - jumped
   2085 - down
   2086 - from
   2087 - above
   2088 - the
   2089 - trench
   2090 - It
   2091 - was
   2092 - a
   2093 - flash
   2094 - of
   2095 - movement
   2096 - and
   2097 - it
   2098 - took
   2099 - a
   2100 - moment
   2101 - for
   2102 - Arthur
   2103 - to
   2104 - process
   2105 - that
   2106 - at
   2107 - its
   2108 - heart
   2109 - was
   2110 - a
   2111 - seven-foot-tall
   2112 - armored
   2113 - stick
   2114 - insect
   2115 - holding
   2116 - a
   2117 - tube
   2118 - in
   2119 - its
   2120 - first
   2121 - lot
   2122 - of
   2123 - spiked
   2124 - forearms
   2125 - and
   2126 - pointing
   2127 - it
   2128 - at
   2129 - Arthur
   2130 - Before
   2131 - he
   2132 - could
   2133 - react
   2134 - he
   2135 - heard
   2136 - the
   2137 - squealing
   2138 - noise
   2139 - up
   2140 - close
   2141 - for
   2142 - the
   2143 - first
   2144 - time
   2145 - and
   2146 - felt
   2147 - a
   2148 - savage
   2149 - pain
   2150 - as
   2151 - golden
   2152 - blood
   2153 - suddenly
   2154 - boiled
   2155 - out
   2156 - of
   2157 - a
   2158 - hole
   2159 - that
   2160 - went
   2161 - straight
   2162 - through
   2163 - the
   2164 - bicep
   2165 - of
   2166 - his
   2167 - left
   2168 - arm
   2169 - Arthur
   2170 - turned
   2171 - the
   2172 - mirror
   2173 - and
   2174 - directed
   2175 - his
   2176 - will
   2177 - The
   2178 - Fifth
   2179 - Key
   2180 - caught
   2181 - the
   2182 - red
   2183 - sunlight
   2184 - gathered
   2185 - it
   2186 - up
   2187 - and
   2188 - concentrated
   2189 - it
   2190 - a
   2191 - millionfold
   2192 - before
   2193 - projecting
   2194 - it
   2195 - at
   2196 - Arthur‘s
   2197 - enemy
   2198 - in
   2199 - a
   2200 - tightly
   2201 - focused
   2202 - beam
   2203 - The
   2204 - insect
   2205 - was
   2206 - cut
   2207 - cleanly
   2208 - in
   2209 - two
   2210 - But
   2211 - the
   2212 - top
   2213 - half
   2214 - continued
   2215 - to
   2216 - scrabble
   2217 - towards
   2218 - Arthur
   2219 - and
   2220 - the
   2221 - forearms
   2222 - tried
   2223 - to
   2224 - aim
   2225 - the
   2226 - tube
   2227 - again
   2228 - Arthur
   2229 - furious
   2230 - and
   2231 - in
   2232 - pain
   2233 - directed
   2234 - his
   2235 - anger
   2236 - through
   2237 - the
   2238 - mirror
   2239 - This
   2240 - time
   2241 - the
   2242 - Fifth
   2243 - Key
   2244 - conjured
   2245 - up
   2246 - a
   2247 - roaring
   2248 - column
   2249 - of
   2250 - fire
   2251 - that
   2252 - stretched
   2253 - from
   2254 - the
   2255 - ground
   2256 - up
   2257 - into
   2258 - the
   2259 - stratosphere
   2260 - and
   2261 - completely
   2262 - incinerated
   2263 - everything
   2264 - in
   2265 - the
   2266 - trench
   2267 - in
   2268 - front
   2269 - of
   2270 - Arthur
   2271 - for
   2272 - at
   2273 - least
   2274 - a
   2275 - hundred
   2276 - yards
   2277 - As
   2278 - the
   2279 - fiery
   2280 - column
   2281 - slowly
   2282 - sank
   2283 - back
   2284 - to
   2285 - the
   2286 - ground
   2287 - Arthur
   2288 - spun
   2289 - around
   2290 - again
   2291 - checking
   2292 - behind
   2293 - him
   2294 - He
   2295 - listened
   2296 - for
   2297 - the
   2298 - squealing
   2299 - noises
   2300 - and
   2301 - though
   2302 - he
   2303 - couldn‘t
   2304 - hear
   2305 - them
   2306 - he
   2307 - heard
   2308 - something
   2309 - else
   2310 - a
   2311 - clicking
   2312 - noise
   2313 - getting
   2314 - louder
   2315 - and
   2316 - closer
   2317 - Arthur
   2318 - knew
   2319 - what
   2320 - it
   2321 - was
   2322 - –
   2323 - the
   2324 - sound
   2325 - the
   2326 - insect
   2327 - soldier‘s
   2328 - limbs
   2329 - had
   2330 - made
   2331 - when
   2332 - it
   2333 - had
   2334 - moved
   2335 - but
   2336 - magnified
   2337 - a
   2338 - thousand
   2339 - times
   2340 - He
   2341 - jumped
   2342 - up
   2343 - on
   2344 - the
   2345 - trench‘s
   2346 - firing
   2347 - step
   2348 - and
   2349 - looked
   2350 - out
   2351 - on
   2352 - to
   2353 - the
   2354 - yellow
   2355 - mud
   2356 - no-man‘s-land
   2357 - of
   2358 - this
   2359 - alien
   2360 - war
   2361 - Thousands
   2362 - of
   2363 - stick-insect
   2364 - soldiers
   2365 - were
   2366 - marching
   2367 - towards
   2368 - him
   2369 - all
   2370 - perfectly
   2371 - in
   2372 - step
   2373 - all
   2374 - holding
   2375 - those
   2376 - squealing
   2377 - tubes
   2378 - I
   2379 - could
   2380 - kill
   2381 - them
   2382 - all
   2383 - from
   2384 - here
   2385 - thought
   2386 - Arthur
   2387 - He
   2388 - felt
   2389 - a
   2390 - feral
   2391 - grin
   2392 - begin
   2393 - to
   2394 - spread
   2395 - across
   2396 - his
   2397 - face
   2398 - before
   2399 - he
   2400 - pushed
   2401 - it
   2402 - away
   2403 - He
   2404 - had
   2405 - the
   2406 - power
   2407 - it
   2408 - was
   2409 - true
   2410 - but
   2411 - he
   2412 - knew
   2413 - he
   2414 - didn‘t
   2415 - have
   2416 - the
   2417 - right
   2418 - They
   2419 - weren‘t
   2420 - even
   2421 - really
   2422 - enemies
   2423 - they
   2424 - knew
   2425 - nothing
   2426 - of
   2427 - the
   2428 - struggles
   2429 - in
   2430 - the
   2431 - House
   2432 - They
   2433 - might
   2434 - look
   2435 - like
   2436 - giant
   2437 - stick
   2438 - insects
   2439 - but
   2440 - obviously
   2441 - they
   2442 - were
   2443 - sentient
   2444 - beings
   2445 - as
   2446 - technologically
   2447 - advanced
   2448 - as
   2449 - humans
   2450 - perhaps
   2451 - even
   2452 - more
   2453 - so
   2454 - So
   2455 - what
   2456 - thought
   2457 - Arthur
   2458 - I‘m
   2459 - no
   2460 - longer
   2461 - human
   2462 - I
   2463 - am
   2464 - Lord
   2465 - Arthur
   2466 - Rightful
   2467 - Heir
   2468 - to
   2469 - the
   2470 - Architect
   2471 - I
   2472 - could
   2473 - kill
   2474 - ten
   2475 - thousand
   2476 - humans
   2477 - as
   2478 - easily
   2479 - as
   2480 - ten
   2481 - thousand
   2482 - alien
   2483 - insects
   2484 - He
   2485 - began
   2486 - to
   2487 - raise
   2488 - the
   2489 - mirror
   2490 - visualizing
   2491 - an
   2492 - even
   2493 - bigger
   2494 - more
   2495 - awesome
   2496 - column
   2497 - of
   2498 - fire
   2499 - one
   2500 - that
   2501 - stretched
   2502 - from
   2503 - horizon
   2504 - to
   2505 - horizon
   2506 - saving
   2507 - only
   2508 - him
   2509 - from
   2510 - the
   2511 - inferno
   2512 - No
   2513 - whispered
   2514 - Arthur
   2515 - He
   2516 - forced
   2517 - his
   2518 - self-righteous
   2519 - pride
   2520 - and
   2521 - anger
   2522 - back
   2523 - I
   2524 - am
   2525 - me…I‘m
   2526 - not
   2527 - Lord
   2528 - Arthur
   2529 - and
   2530 - this
   2531 - is
   2532 - wrong
   2533 - All
   2534 - I
   2535 - have
   2536 - to
   2537 - do
   2538 - is
   2539 - leave
   2540 - ”
   2541 - He
   2542 - swung
   2543 - the
   2544 - mirror
   2545 - round
   2546 - and
   2547 - looked
   2548 - into
   2549 - it
   2550 - trying
   2551 - to
   2552 - think
   2553 - of
   2554 - Sir
   2555 - Thursday‘s
   2556 - chamber
   2557 - and
   2558 - not
   2559 - all
   2560 - the
   2561 - destructive
   2562 - things
   2563 - he
   2564 - could
   2565 - do
   2566 - to
   2567 - anyone
   2568 - or
   2569 - anything
   2570 - that
   2571 - opposed
   2572 - him
   2573 - But
   2574 - he
   2575 - couldn‘t
   2576 - focus
   2577 - –
   2578 - it
   2579 - was
   2580 - all
   2581 - he
   2582 - could
   2583 - do
   2584 - to
   2585 - keep
   2586 - his
   2587 - rage
   2588 - in
   2589 - check
   2590 - He
   2591 - really
   2592 - wanted
   2593 - to
   2594 - destroy
   2595 - the
   2596 - insect
   2597 - soldiers
   2598 - and
   2599 - every
   2600 - time
   2601 - he
   2602 - almost
   2603 - had
   2604 - a
   2605 - mental
   2606 - picture
   2607 - of
   2608 - Thursday‘s
   2609 - room
   2610 - it
   2611 - was
   2612 - replaced
   2613 - by
   2614 - images
   2615 - of
   2616 - fire
   2617 - and
   2618 - destruction
   2619 - As
   2620 - Arthur
   2621 - struggled
   2622 - with
   2623 - his
   2624 - thoughts
   2625 - the
   2626 - mirror
   2627 - remained
   2628 - constant
   2629 - He
   2630 - saw
   2631 - only
   2632 - his
   2633 - reflection
   2634 - the
   2635 - now
   2636 - all-too-perfect
   2637 - face
   2638 - so
   2639 - handsome
   2640 - that
   2641 - even
   2642 - a
   2643 - beard
   2644 - of
   2645 - frost
   2646 - could
   2647 - not
   2648 - lessen
   2649 - his
   2650 - unearthly
   2651 - beauty
   2652 - Arthur
   2653 - groaned
   2654 - and
   2655 - put
   2656 - the
   2657 - mirror
   2658 - back
   2659 - in
   2660 - his
   2661 - pouch
   2662 - The
   2663 - horde
   2664 - of
   2665 - insect
   2666 - warriors
   2667 - was
   2668 - approaching
   2669 - at
   2670 - a
   2671 - steady
   2672 - pace
   2673 - and
   2674 - had
   2675 - neither
   2676 - slowed
   2677 - nor
   2678 - speeded
   2679 - its
   2680 - advance
   2681 - The
   2682 - forward
   2683 - ranks
   2684 - hadn‘t
   2685 - aimed
   2686 - their
   2687 - weapons
   2688 - either
   2689 - but
   2690 - he
   2691 - suspected
   2692 - he
   2693 - was
   2694 - probably
   2695 - in
   2696 - range
   2697 - Arthur
   2698 - looked
   2699 - at
   2700 - the
   2701 - hole
   2702 - in
   2703 - his
   2704 - arm
   2705 - It
   2706 - was
   2707 - neatly
   2708 - cauterized
   2709 - but
   2710 - he
   2711 - could
   2712 - see
   2713 - right
   2714 - through
   2715 - from
   2716 - one
   2717 - side
   2718 - to
   2719 - the
   2720 - other
   2721 - Only
   2722 - his
   2723 - sorcerously
   2724 - altered
   2725 - body
   2726 - allowed
   2727 - him
   2728 - to
   2729 - cope
   2730 - with
   2731 - such
   2732 - a
   2733 - wound
   2734 - It
   2735 - felt
   2736 - about
   2737 - as
   2738 - painful
   2739 - as
   2740 - a
   2741 - paper
   2742 - cut
   2743 - to
   2744 - him
   2745 - now
   2746 - But
   2747 - he
   2748 - knew
   2749 - he
   2750 - could
   2751 - not
   2752 - survive
   2753 - a
   2754 - hundred
   2755 - –
   2756 - or
   2757 - a
   2758 - thousand
   2759 - –
   2760 - such
   2761 - wounds
   2762 - He
   2763 - also
   2764 - knew
   2765 - that
   2766 - the
   2767 - rage
   2768 - he
   2769 - was
   2770 - barely
   2771 - keeping
   2772 - inside
   2773 - him
   2774 - would
   2775 - come
   2776 - out
   2777 - long
   2778 - before
   2779 - then
   2780 - and
   2781 - that
   2782 - he
   2783 - would
   2784 - use
   2785 - the
   2786 - Keys
   2787 - to
   2788 - wreak
   2789 - destruction
   2790 - such
   2791 - as
   2792 - even
   2793 - these
   2794 - warring
   2795 - aliens
   2796 - had
   2797 - never
   2798 - imagined
   2799 - I
   2800 - have
   2801 - to
   2802 - get
   2803 - out

   2807 - Arthur
   2808 - Before
   2809 - I
   2810 - do
   2811 - something
   2812 - terrible…
   2813 - He
   2814 - jumped
   2815 - back
   2816 - down
   2817 - and
   2818 - tried
   2819 - to
   2820 - visualize
   2821 - the
   2822 - Improbable
   2823 - Stair
   2824 - That
   2825 - could
   2826 - be
   2827 - its
   2828 - first
   2829 - step
   2830 - there
   2831 - the
   2832 - pale
   2833 - blue
   2834 - sandbag
   2835 - that
   2836 - was
   2837 - the
   2838 - firing
   2839 - step
   2840 - of
   2841 - the
   2842 - trench
   2843 - It
   2844 - just
   2845 - had
   2846 - to
   2847 - turn
   2848 - white
   2849 - and
   2850 - luminous
   2851 - and
   2852 - that
   2853 - would
   2854 - be
   2855 - the
   2856 - way
   2857 - in

   2859 - and

   2870 - Ahead
   2871 - of

   2873 - the
   2874 - clicking
   2875 - noise
   2876 - suddenly
   2877 - increased
   2878 - in
   2879 - volume
   2880 - and
   2881 - tempo
   2882 - The

   2897 - zing
   2898 - went
   2899 - over

   3529 - building

   5873 - stumbled
   5874 - on
   5875 - the
   5876 - Stair
   5877 - and
   5878 - almost
   5879 - lost
   5880 - his
   5881 - balance
   5882 - before
   5883 - some
   5884 - primal
   5885 - instinct
   5886 - separate
   5887 - from
   5888 - any
   5889 - intelligence
   5890 - forced
   5891 - him
   5892 - to
   5893 - stagger
   5894 - up
   5895 - the
   5896 - steps
   5897 - Golden
   5898 - blood
   5899 - streamed
   5900 - down
   5901 - his
   5902 - cheek
   5903 - and
   5904 - dripped
   5905 - upon
   5906 - the
   5907 - Stair
   5908 - Arthur
   5909 - wiped
   5910 - it
   5911 - away
   5912 - and
   5913 - inadvertently
   5914 - felt
   5915 - what
   5916 - had
   5917 - to
   5918 - be
   5919 - a
   5920 - gaping
   5921 - hole
   5922 - in
   5923 - the
   5924 - side
   5925 - of
   5926 - his
   5927 - head
   5928 - above
   5929 - where
   5930 - his
   5931 - ear
   5932 - used
   5933 - to
   5934 - be
   5935 - My
   5936 - ear‘s
   5937 - gone
   5938 - thought
   5939 - Arthur
   5940 - shock
   5941 - beginning
   5942 - to
   5943 - leapfrog
   5944 - through
   5945 - his
   5946 - body
   5947 - I‘m
   5948 - going
   5949 - to
   5950 - die…but
   5951 - I
   5952 - can‘t
   5953 - die…
   5954 - He
   5955 - staggered
   5956 - up
   5957 - another
   5958 - few
   5959 - steps
   5960 - There
   5961 - was
   5962 - golden
   5963 - blood
   5964 - in
   5965 - his
   5966 - eyes
   5967 - now
   5968 - and
   5969 - a
   5970 - terrible
   5971 - chill
   5972 - was
   5973 - spreading
   5974 - through
   5975 - the
   5976 - right
   5977 - side
   5978 - of
   5979 - his
   5980 - head
   5981 - and
   5982 - down
   5983 - his
   5984 - right
   5985 - arm
   5986 - and
   5987 - leg
   5988 - It
   5989 - was
   5990 - becoming
   5991 - harder
   5992 - to
   5993 - move
   5994 - he
   5995 - had
   5996 - to
   5997 - step
   5998 - up
   5999 - with
   6000 - his
   6001 - left
   6002 - foot
   6003 - and
   6004 - then
   6005 - drag
   6006 - his
   6007 - right
   6008 - leg
   6009 - after
   6010 - him
   6011 - If
   6012 - it
   6013 - got
   6014 - any
   6015 - worse
   6016 - he
   6017 - would
   6018 - fall
   6019 - for
   6020 - sure
   6021 - down
   6022 - the
   6023 - Improbable
   6024 - Stair
   6025 - to
   6026 - some
   6027 - even
   6028 - deadlier
   6029 - place…
   6030 - I
   6031 - have
   6032 - to
   6033 - get
   6034 - somewhere
   6035 - safe
   6036 - somewhere
   6037 - I
   6038 - can
   6039 - recover
   6040 - thought
   6041 - Arthur
   6042 - He
   6043 - tried
   6044 - to
   6045 - visualize
   6046 - Thursday‘s
   6047 - chamber
   6048 - but
   6049 - he
   6050 - couldn‘t
   6051 - Just
   6052 - as
   6053 - a
   6054 - hurt
   6055 - animal
   6056 - desires
   6057 - only
   6058 - its
   6059 - own
   6060 - den
   6061 - all
   6062 - he
   6063 - could
   6064 - think
   6065 - of
   6066 - was
   6067 - his
   6068 - own
   6069 - bed
   6070 - his
   6071 - own
   6072 - room
   6073 - back
   6074 - on
   6075 - Earth
   6076 - But
   6077 - I
   6078 - shouldn‘t
   6079 - go
   6080 - there…It
   6081 - will
   6082 - restart
   6083 - time
   6084 - and
   6085 - the
   6086 - Army
   6087 - is
   6088 - going
   6089 - to
   6090 - nuke
   6091 - the
   6092 - hospital
   6093 - and
   6094 - I‘m
   6095 - in
   6096 - no
   6097 - state
   6098 - to
   6099 - do
   6100 - anything
   6101 - It‘s
   6102 - been
   6103 - so
   6104 - long
   6105 - since
   6106 - I
   6107 - lay
   6108 - on
   6109 - my
   6110 - bed…so
   6111 - long…my
   6112 - bed…
   6113 - The
   6114 - Improbable
   6115 - Stair
   6116 - vanished
   6117 - and
   6118 - Arthur
   6119 - fell
   6120 - into
   6121 - his
   6122 - very
   6123 - own
   6124 - bed
   6125 - He
   6126 - lay
   6127 - there
   6128 - stunned
   6129 - for
   6130 - what
   6131 - felt
   6132 - like
   6133 - a
   6134 - very
   6135 - long
   6136 - time
   6137 - He
   6138 - couldn‘t
   6139 - move
   6140 - and
   6141 - after
   6142 - a
   6143 - little
   6144 - while
   6145 - he
   6146 - realized
   6147 - that
   6148 - he
   6149 - could
   6150 - only
   6151 - see
   6152 - out
   6153 - of
   6154 - his
   6155 - left
   6156 - eye
   6157 - He
   6158 - was
   6159 - also
   6160 - unable
   6161 - to
   6162 - move
   6163 - his
   6164 - head
   6165 - so
   6166 - he
   6167 - lay
   6168 - there
   6169 - on
   6170 - his
   6171 - side
   6172 - his
   6173 - one
   6174 - good
   6175 - eye
   6176 - slowly
   6177 - scanning
   6178 - his
   6179 - bedroom
   6180 - It
   6181 - was
   6182 - just
   6183 - barely
   6184 - light
   6185 - outside
   6186 - the
   6187 - window
   6188 - the
   6189 - sky
   6190 - showing
   6191 - the
   6192 - faint
   6193 - glow
   6194 - that
   6195 - precedes
   6196 - the
   6197 - dawn
   6198 - His
   6199 - desk
   6200 - lamp
   6201 - was
   6202 - on
   6203 - casting
   6204 - its
   6205 - fairly
   6206 - ineffectual
   6207 - circle
   6208 - of
   6209 - light
   6210 - The
   6211 - clock
   6212 - on
   6213 - the
   6214 - wall
   6215 - said
   6216 - half
   6217 - past
   6218 - ten
   6219 - which
   6220 - was
   6221 - clearly
   6222 - wrong
   6223 - given
   6224 - the
   6225 - light
   6226 - outside
   6227 - Arthur
   6228 - watched
   6229 - the
   6230 - minute
   6231 - hand
   6232 - for
   6233 - a
   6234 - while
   6235 - and
   6236 - saw
   6237 - that
   6238 - the
   6239 - clock
   6240 - had
   6241 - stopped
   6242 - perhaps
   6243 - days
   6244 - ago
   6245 - Apart
   6246 - from
   6247 - the
   6248 - stopped
   6249 - clock
   6250 - the
   6251 - room
   6252 - looked
   6253 - exactly
   6254 - as
   6255 - it
   6256 - had
   6257 - always
   6258 - looked
   6259 - which
   6260 - he
   6261 - supposed
   6262 - was
   6263 - a
   6264 - good
   6265 - sign
   6266 - Even
   6267 - the
   6268 - stopped
   6269 - clock
   6270 - might
   6271 - be
   6272 - a
   6273 - positive
   6274 - because
   6275 - time
   6276 - itself
   6277 - might
   6278 - still
   6279 - be
   6280 - frozen
   6281 - temporarily
   6282 - halted
   6283 - by
   6284 - the
   6285 - power
   6286 - of
   6287 - the
   6288 - Fifth
   6289 - Key
   6290 - Arthur
   6291 - had
   6292 - done
   6293 - that
   6294 - because
   6295 - the
   6296 - Army
   6297 - temporarily
   6298 - controlled
   6299 - by
   6300 - Saturday‘s
   6301 - minion
   6302 - Pravuil
   6303 - in
   6304 - the
   6305 - guise
   6306 - of
   6307 - a
   6308 - General
   6309 - had
   6310 - been
   6311 - about
   6312 - to
   6313 - destroy
   6314 - East
   6315 - Area
   6316 - Hospital
   6317 - with
   6318 - micronukes
   6319 - supposedly
   6320 - in
   6321 - order
   6322 - to
   6323 - eradicate
   6324 - the
   6325 - Sleepy
   6326 - Plague
   6327 - Greyspot
   6328 - and
   6329 - other
   6330 - viruses
   6331 - that
   6332 - were
   6333 - concentrated
   6334 - at
   6335 - the
   6336 - hospital
   6337 - Arthur
   6338 - hoped
   6339 - it
   6340 - was
   6341 - still
   6342 - a
   6343 - few
   6344 - minutes
   6345 - before
   6346 - midnight
   6347 - on
   6348 - Friday
   6349 - and
   6350 - that
   6351 - he‘d
   6352 - come
   6353 - back
   6354 - in
   6355 - time
   6356 - to
   6357 - properly
   6358 - stop
   6359 - the
   6360 - nuclear
   6361 - attack
   6362 - But
   6363 - when
   6364 - he‘d
   6365 - stopped
   6366 - time
   6367 - there
   6368 - had
   6369 - been
   6370 - a
   6371 - strange
   6372 - red
   6373 - tinge
   6374 - to
   6375 - the
   6376 - light
   6377 - Arthur
   6378 - couldn‘t
   6379 - see
   6380 - that
   6381 - now
   6382 - And
   6383 - what‘s
   6384 - more
   6385 - Arthur
   6386 - had
   6387 - come
   6388 - back
   6389 - from
   6390 - the
   6391 - Incomparable
   6392 - Gardens
   6393 - albeit
   6394 - indirectly
   6395 - Returning
   6396 - from
   6397 - the
   6398 - seventh
   6399 - demesne
   6400 - of
   6401 - the
   6402 - House
   6403 - would
   6404 - mean
   6405 - returning
   6406 - to
   6407 - Earth
   6408 - on
   6409 - a
   6410 - Sunday
   6411 - –
   6412 - and
   6413 - in
   6414 - order
   6415 - for
   6416 - it
   6417 - to
   6418 - be
   6419 - a
   6420 - Sunday
   6421 - time
   6422 - must
   6423 - have
   6424 - passed
   6425 - since
   6426 - he‘d
   6427 - frozen
   6428 - it
   6429 - on
   6430 - Friday
   6431 - Which
   6432 - meant
   6433 - it
   6434 - was
   6435 - probably
   6436 - more
   6437 - than
   6438 - a
   6439 - day
   6440 - since
   6441 - the
   6442 - Army
   6443 - had
   6444 - nuked
   6445 - the
   6446 - hospital
   6447 - and
   6448 - the
   6449 - only
   6450 - reason
   6451 - everything
   6452 - seemed
   6453 - OK
   6454 - was
   6455 - that
   6456 - the
   6457 - house
   6458 - was
   6459 - far
   6460 - enough
   6461 - away
   6462 - not
   6463 - to
   6464 - be
   6465 - destroyed
   6466 - by
   6467 - the
   6468 - blast
   6469 - Though
   6470 - it
   6471 - would
   6472 - still
   6473 - be
   6474 - affected
   6475 - by
   6476 - radiation
   6477 - Arthur
   6478 - thought
   6479 - and
   6480 - that
   6481 - led
   6482 - him
   6483 - to
   6484 - attempt
   6485 - to
   6486 - get
   6487 - up
   6488 - If
   6489 - any
   6490 - of
   6491 - his
   6492 - family
   6493 - was
   6494 - at
   6495 - home
   6496 - he
   6497 - had
   6498 - to
   6499 - help
   6500 - them
   6501 - He
   6502 - hoped
   6503 - his
   6504 - mother
   6505 - would
   6506 - be
   6507 - there
   6508 - but
   6509 - in
   6510 - his
   6511 - heart
   6512 - he
   6513 - knew
   6514 - that
   6515 - wasn‘t
   6516 - going
   6517 - to
   6518 - happen
   6519 - since
   6520 - he
   6521 - knew
   6522 - she
   6523 - hadn‘t
   6524 - been
   6525 - on
   6526 - Earth
   6527 - since
   6528 - before
   6529 - he
   6530 - defeated
   6531 - Lady
   6532 - Friday
   6533 - and
   6534 - was
   6535 - probably
   6536 - a
   6537 - prisoner
   6538 - of
   6539 - either
   6540 - Superior
   6541 - Saturday
   6542 - Lord
   6543 - Sunday
   6544 - or
   6545 - even
   6546 - the
   6547 - Piper
   6548 - At
   6549 - least
   6550 - his
   6551 - father
   6552 - was
   6553 - safely
   6554 - far
   6555 - away
   6556 - on
   6557 - tour
   6558 - with
   6559 - his
   6560 - band
   6561 - The
   6562 - Ratz
   6563 - His
   6564 - oldest
   6565 - brother
   6566 - Erazmuz
   6567 - was
   6568 - in
   6569 - the
   6570 - Army
   6571 - in
   6572 - fact
   6573 - with
   6574 - the
   6575 - clean-up
   6576 - operation
   6577 - that
   6578 - would
   6579 - follow
   6580 - the
   6581 - nuclear
   6582 - attack
   6583 - Staria
   6584 - Patrick
   6585 - and
   6586 - Suzanne
   6587 - like
   6588 - Erazmuz
   6589 - were
   6590 - much
   6591 - older
   6592 - and
   6593 - all
   6594 - lived
   6595 - in
   6596 - other
   6597 - cities
   6598 - That
   6599 - left
   6600 - Arthur‘s
   6601 - sister
   6602 - Michaeli
   6603 - and
   6604 - his
   6605 - brother
   6606 - Eric
   6607 - who
   6608 - normally
   6609 - lived
   6610 - at

   6612 - or
   6613 - at
   6614 - least
   6615 - theoretically
   6616 - did
   6617 - since
   6618 - both
   6619 - spent
   6620 - a
   6621 - lot
   6622 - of
   6623 - time
   6624 - with
   6625 - friends
   6626 - But
   6627 - they
   6628 - could
   6629 - be
   6630 - here
   6631 - and
   6632 - in
   6633 - danger
   6634 - He
   6635 - had
   6636 - to
   6637 - get
   6638 - up
   6639 - and
   6640 - see
   6641 - But
   6642 - when
   6643 - he
   6644 - tried
   6645 - to
   6646 - move
   6647 - he
   6648 - felt
   6649 - the
   6650 - pain
   6651 - in
   6652 - his
   6653 - head
   6654 - increase
   6655 - and
   6656 - the
   6657 - cold
   6658 - paralysis
   6659 - that
   6660 - affected
   6661 - his
   6662 - entire
   6663 - right
   6664 - side
   6665 - grew
   6666 - stronger
   6667 - Arthur
   6668 - shut
   6669 - his
   6670 - good
   6671 - eye
   6672 - Slowly
   6673 - with
   6674 - a
   6675 - hand
   6676 - that
   6677 - felt
   6678 - ridiculously
   6679 - weak
   6680 - he
   6681 - felt
   6682 - into
   6683 - the
   6684 - pouch
   6685 - and
   6686 - closed
   6687 - his
   6688 - bloodied
   6689 - fingers
   6690 - on
   6691 - the
   6692 - Fifth
   6693 - Key
   6694 - Using
   6695 - sorcery
   6696 - here
   6697 - on
   6698 - Earth
   6699 - was
   6700 - bad
   6701 - since
   6702 - it
   6703 - would
   6704 - affect
   6705 - the
   6706 - world
   6707 - in
   6708 - a
   6709 - negative
   6710 - way
   6711 - but
   6712 - he
   6713 - didn‘t
   6714 - really
   6715 - have
   6716 - a
   6717 - choice
   6718 - other
   6719 - than
   6720 - to
   6721 - use
   6722 - only
   6723 - one
   6724 - of
   6725 - the
   6726 - two
   6727 - Keys
   6728 - to

   6730 - the

   6733 - on
   6734 - the

   6741 - for
   6742 - his
   6743 - body
   6744 - to
   6745 - heal
   6746 - itself
   6747 - though
   6748 - he
   6749 - knew
   6750 - it
   6751 - probably
   6752 - would
   6753 - in
   6754 - time
   6755 - He
   6756 - had
   6757 - to
   6758 - use
   6759 - sorcery
   6760 - to
   6761 - accelerate
   6762 - his
   6763 - healing
   6764 - He
   6765 - tried
   6766 - not
   6767 - to
   6768 - think
   6769 - of
   6770 - the
   6771 - hole
   6772 - he‘d
   6773 - felt
   6774 - in
   6775 - his
   6776 - head
   6777 - and
   6778 - how
   6779 - in
   6780 - this
   6781 - case
   6782 - healing
   6783 - probably
   6784 - meant
   6785 - regrowing
   6786 - part
   6787 - of
   6788 - his
   6789 - brain
   6790 - Arthur
   6791 - gripped
   6792 - the
   6793 - mirror
   6794 - harder
   6795 - concentrated
   6796 - his
   6797 - mind
   6798 - on
   6799 - what
   6800 - he
   6801 - wanted
   6802 - to
   6803 - happen
   6804 - and
   6805 - muttered
   6806 - fiercely
   6807 - Fifth
   6808 - Key
   6809 - Heal
   6810 - me
   6811 - make
   6812 - me
   6813 - good
   6814 - as
   6815 - new
   6816 - as
   6817 - quickly
   6818 - as
   6819 - you
   6820 - can
   6821 - ”
   6822 - A
   6823 - terrible
   6824 - explosive
   6825 - pain
   6826 - shot
   6827 - up
   6828 - Arthur‘s
   6829 - fingers
   6830 - He
   6831 - cried
   6832 - out
   6833 - and
   6834 - then
   6835 - began
   6836 - to
   6837 - sob
   6838 - as
   6839 - his
   6840 - body
   6841 - was
   6842 - twisted
   6843 - from
   6844 - side
   6845 - to
   6846 - side
   6847 - and
   6848 - the
   6849 - bones
   6850 - in
   6851 - his
   6852 - spine
   6853 - cracked
   6854 - and
   6855 - screeched
   6856 - He
   6857 - felt
   6858 - his
   6859 - skull
   6860 - knitting
   6861 - back
   6862 - together
   6863 - and
   6864 - the
   6865 - skin
   6866 - stretching
   6867 - across
   6868 - all
   6869 - of
   6870 - it
   6871 - accompanied
   6872 - by
   6873 - almost
   6874 - unbearable
   6875 - agony
   6876 - Then
   6877 - it
   6878 - was
   6879 - over
   6880 - Arthur
   6881 - felt
   6882 - limp
   6883 - and
   6884 - tired
   6885 - but
   6886 - otherwise
   6887 - all
   6888 - right
   6889 - Gingerly
   6890 - he
   6891 - opened
   6892 - his
   6893 - right
   6894 - eye
   6895 - He
   6896 - could
   6897 - see
   6898 - perfectly
   6899 - well
   6900 - through
   6901 - it
   6902 - but
   6903 - just
   6904 - to
   6905 - test
   6906 - it
   6907 - out
   6908 - he
   6909 - read
   6910 - the
   6911 - titles
   6912 - on
   6913 - the
   6914 - spines
   6915 - of
   6916 - the
   6917 - books
   6918 - in
   6919 - the
   6920 - shelf
   6921 - above
   6922 - his
   6923 - desk
   6924 - pleased
   6925 - to
   6926 - note
   6927 - that
   6928 - even
   6929 - in
   6930 - the
   6931 - dim
   6932 - light
   6933 - from
   6934 - the
   6935 - lamp
   6936 - he
   6937 - could
   6938 - read
   6939 - the
   6940 - smallest
   6941 - type
   6942 - Arthur
   6943 - was
   6944 - just
   6945 - about
   6946 - to
   6947 - look
   6948 - away
   6949 - when
   6950 - he
   6951 - saw
   6952 - the
   6953 - small
   6954 - book
   6955 - on
   6956 - the
   6957 - far
   6958 - end
   6959 - of
   6960 - the
   6961 - shelf
   6962 - a
   6963 - book
   6964 - that
   6965 - shed
   6966 - a
   6967 - soft
   6968 - and
   6969 - rippling
   6970 - blue
   6971 - light
   6972 - He
   6973 - opened
   6974 - both
   6975 - eyes
   6976 - to
   6977 - make
   6978 - sure
   6979 - of
   6980 - what
   6981 - he
   6982 - was
   6983 - seeing
   6984 - Certain
   6985 - he
   6986 - jumped
   6987 - up
   6988 - and
   6989 - snatched
   6990 - it
   6991 - off
   6992 - the
   6993 - shelf
   6994 - sitting
   6995 - back
   6996 - down
   6997 - with
   6998 - the
   6999 - slim
   7000 - green-bound
   7001 - notebook
   7002 - held
   7003 - fast
   7004 - in
   7005 - his
   7006 - right
   7007 - hand
   7008 - A
   7009 - Complete
   7010 - Atlas
   7011 - of
   7012 - the
   7013 - House
   7014 - and
   7015 - Immediate
   7016 - Environs
   7017 - was
   7018 - back
   7019 - in
   7020 - Arthur‘s
   7021 - possession
   7022 - Arthur
   7023 - patted
   7024 - the
   7025 - cover
   7026 - then
   7027 - put
   7028 - the
   7029 - Atlas
   7030 - carefully
   7031 - away
   7032 - in
   7033 - the
   7034 - silver
   7035 - pouch
   7036 - As
   7037 - he
   7038 - straightened
   7039 - up
   7040 - from
   7041 - doing
   7042 - that
   7043 - he
   7044 - caught
   7045 - a
   7046 - glimpse
   7047 - of
   7048 - himself
   7049 - in
   7050 - the
   7051 - mirror
   7052 - on
   7053 - the
   7054 - back
   7055 - of
   7056 - the
   7057 - door
   7058 - the
   7059 - mirror
   7060 - that
   7061 - his
   7062 - mother
   7063 - had
   7064 - insisted
   7065 - on
   7066 - putting
   7067 - there
   7068 - so
   7069 - he
   7070 - would
   7071 - remember
   7072 - to
   7073 - comb
   7074 - his
   7075 - hair
   7076 - before
   7077 - he
   7078 - came
   7079 - down
   7080 - in
   7081 - the
   7082 - morning
   7083 - Arthur
   7084 - looked
   7085 - at
   7086 - the
   7087 - reflection
   7088 - for
   7089 - a
   7090 - few
   7091 - seconds
   7092 - then
   7093 - moved
   7094 - closer
   7095 - to
   7096 - the
   7097 - mirror
   7098 - to
   7099 - study
   7100 - what
   7101 - he
   7102 - had
   7103 - become
   7104 - He
   7105 - had
   7106 - been
   7107 - healed
   7108 - true
   7109 - enough
   7110 - But
   7111 - he
   7112 - had
   7113 - also
   7114 - been
   7115 - changed
   7116 - again
   7117 - His
   7118 - hair
   7119 - had
   7120 - become
   7121 - spun
   7122 - gold
   7123 - all
   7124 - perfectly
   7125 - arranged
   7126 - and
   7127 - shining
   7128 - His
   7129 - skin
   7130 - had
   7131 - become
   7132 - a
   7133 - deep
   7134 - red-
   7135 - bronze
   7136 - smooth
   7137 - and
   7138 - poreless
   7139 - There
   7140 - was
   7141 - no
   7142 - white
   7143 - in
   7144 - his
   7145 - eyes
   7146 - just
   7147 - a
   7148 - soft
   7149 - golden
   7150 - glow
   7151 - around
   7152 - an
   7153 - utterly
   7154 - black
   7155 - pupil
   7156 - and
   7157 - iris
   7158 - I
   7159 - look
   7160 - like
   7161 - some
   7162 - kind
   7163 - of
   7164 - android
   7165 - thought
   7166 - Arthur
   7167 - bitterly
   7168 - Or
   7169 - a
   7170 - statue
   7171 - that‘s
   7172 - stepped
   7173 - off
   7174 - its
   7175 - stand
   7176 - He
   7177 - stared
   7178 - for
   7179 - a
   7180 - moment
   7181 - longer
   7182 - before
   7183 - looking
   7184 - down
   7185 - at
   7186 - the
   7187 - crocodile
   7188 - ring
   7189 - on
   7190 - his
   7191 - finger
   7192 - It
   7193 - was
   7194 - now
   7195 - entirely
   7196 - gold
   7197 - Not
   7198 - even
   7199 - a
   7200 - glimmer
   7201 - of
   7202 - silver
   7203 - remained
   7204 - to
   7205 - show
   7206 - that
   7207 - some
   7208 - last
   7209 - vestige
   7210 - of
   7211 - humanity
   7212 - remained
   7213 - in
   7214 - his
   7215 - blood
   7216 - and
   7217 - bones
   7218 - His
   7219 - body
   7220 - was
   7221 - one
   7222 - hundred
   7223 - per
   7224 - cent
   7225 - Denizen
   7226 - Or
   7227 - perhaps
   7228 - even
   7229 - something
   7230 - more
   7231 - as
   7232 - the
   7233 - gold
   7234 - shimmered
   7235 - with
   7236 - its
   7237 - own
   7238 - soft
   7239 - light
   7240 - and
   7241 - its
   7242 - color
   7243 - varied
   7244 - from
   7245 - a
   7246 - rose
   7247 - gold
   7248 - to
   7249 - the
   7250 - butter
   7251 - yellow
   7252 - of
   7253 - the
   7254 - pure
   7255 - metal
   7256 - Arthur
   7257 - shut
   7258 - his
   7259 - eyes
   7260 - for
   7261 - a
   7262 - moment
   7263 - and
   7264 - shook
   7265 - his
   7266 - head
   7267 - trying
   7268 - to
   7269 - cast
   7270 - away
   7271 - the
   7272 - feelings
   7273 - of
   7274 - self-
   7275 - pity
   7276 - that
   7277 - were
   7278 - rising
   7279 - inside
   7280 - him
   7281 - I
   7282 - don‘t…I
   7283 - don‘t
   7284 - care
   7285 - he
   7286 - said
   7287 - softly
   7288 - to
   7289 - his
   7290 - reflection
   7291 - I
   7292 - have
   7293 - a
   7294 - job
   7295 - to
   7296 - do
   7297 - It
   7298 - doesn‘t
   7299 - matter
   7300 - what
   7301 - I
   7302 - have
   7303 - become
   7304 - It
   7305 - doesn‘t
   7306 - matter
   7307 - what
   7308 - I
   7309 - look
   7310 - like
   7311 - ”
   7312 - He
   7313 - pushed
   7314 - open
   7315 - the
   7316 - door
   7317 - and
   7318 - softly
   7319 - trod
   7320 - downstairs
   7321 - I
   7322 - hope
   7323 - no
   7324 - one
   7325 - is
   7326 - home
   7327 - he
   7328 - couldn‘t
   7329 - help
   7330 - thinking
   7331 - I
   7332 - hope
   7333 - they‘re
   7334 - safe
   7335 - somewhere
   7336 - else
   7337 - And
   7338 - that
   7339 - they
   7340 - don‘t
   7341 - have
   7342 - to
   7343 - see
   7344 - me
   7345 - this
   7346 - way
   7347 - The
   7348 - house
   7349 - was
   7350 - very
   7351 - quiet
   7352 - Arthur
   7353 - slipped
   7354 - quietly
   7355 - down
   7356 - the
   7357 - stairs
   7358 - pausing
   7359 - to
   7360 - listen
   7361 - every
   7362 - four
   7363 - or
   7364 - five
   7365 - steps
   7366 - He
   7367 - had
   7368 - learned
   7369 - to
   7370 - be
   7371 - cautious
   7372 - He
   7373 - was
   7374 - also
   7375 - wondering
   7376 - what
   7377 - he
   7378 - should
   7379 - do
   7380 - He
   7381 - couldn‘t
   7382 - stay
   7383 - –
   7384 - that
   7385 - was
   7386 - for
   7387 - sure
   7388 - He
   7389 - had
   7390 - to
   7391 - get
   7392 - back
   7393 - to
   7394 - the
   7395 - House
   7396 - as
   7397 - soon
   7398 - as
   7399 - he
   7400 - could
   7401 - But
   7402 - before
   7403 - he
   7404 - did
   7405 - that
   7406 - he
   7407 - might
   7408 - need
   7409 - to
   7410 - stop
   7411 - time
   7412 - again
   7413 - Or
   7414 - perhaps
   7415 - try
   7416 - to
   7417 - clean
   7418 - up
   7419 - whatever
   7420 - had
   7421 - happened…
   7422 - At
   7423 - the
   7424 - landing
   7425 - just
   7426 - before
   7427 - the
   7428 - living
   7429 - room
   7430 - Arthur
   7431 - stopped
   7432 - and
   7433 - took
   7434 - a
   7435 - deep
   7436 - unfettered
   7437 - breath
   7438 - He
   7439 - still
   7440 - found
   7441 - it
   7442 - amazing
   7443 - that
   7444 - he
   7445 - could
   7446 - take
   7447 - such
   7448 - a
   7449 - breath
   7450 - one
   7451 - that
   7452 - went
   7453 - to
   7454 - the
   7455 - very
   7456 - bottom
   7457 - of
   7458 - his
   7459 - lungs
   7460 - and
   7461 - that
   7462 - he
   7463 - could
   7464 - breathe
   7465 - out
   7466 - again
   7467 - without
   7468 - wheezing
   7469 - or
   7470 - difficulty
   7471 - His
   7472 - asthma
   7473 - like
   7474 - his
   7475 - old
   7476 - body
   7477 - and
   7478 - even
   7479 - his
   7480 - old
   7481 - face
   7482 - was
   7483 - apparently
   7484 - gone
   7485 - forever
   7486 - After
   7487 - taking
   7488 - that
   7489 - breath
   7490 - Arthur
   7491 - walked
   7492 - into
   7493 - the
   7494 - living
   7495 - room
   7496 - –
   7497 - and
   7498 - stopped
   7499 - as
   7500 - if
   7501 - he‘d
   7502 - hit
   7503 - a
   7504 - wall
   7505 - There
   7506 - was
   7507 - his
   7508 - mother
   7509 - who
   7510 - was
   7511 - sitting
   7512 - on
   7513 - the
   7514 - sofa
   7515 - and
   7516 - reading
   7517 - a
   7518 - medical
   7519 - journal
   7520 - as
   7521 - if
   7522 - she
   7523 - had
   7524 - never
   7525 - disappeared
   7526 - as
   7527 - if
   7528 - the
   7529 - world
   7530 - outside
   7531 - was
   7532 - normal
   7533 - as
   7534 - if
   7535 - all
   7536 - the
   7537 - things
   7538 - that
   7539 - had
   7540 - happened
   7541 - to
   7542 - Arthur
   7543 - his
   7544 - family
   7545 - and
   7546 - the
   7547 - city
   7548 - had
   7549 - never
   7550 - occurred
   7551 - Arthur
   7552 - took
   7553 - a
   7554 - step
   7555 - forward
   7556 - ready
   7557 - to
   7558 - hurl
   7559 - himself
   7560 - upon
   7561 - her
   7562 - and
   7563 - hug
   7564 - her
   7565 - as
   7566 - tightly
   7567 - as
   7568 - he
   7569 - could
   7570 - to
   7571 - recapture
   7572 - that
   7573 - sense
   7574 - of
   7575 - safety
   7576 - that
   7577 - he
   7578 - had
   7579 - always
   7580 - felt
   7581 - in
   7582 - her
   7583 - embrace
   7584 - But
   7585 - after
   7586 - that
   7587 - first
   7588 - step
   7589 - Arthur
   7590 - hesitated
   7591 - He
   7592 - had
   7593 - changed
   7594 - so
   7595 - much
   7596 - he
   7597 - was
   7598 - so
   7599 - different
   7600 - to
   7601 - look
   7602 - at
   7603 - Emily
   7604 - might
   7605 - not
   7606 - even
   7607 - recognize
   7608 - him
   7609 - Or
   7610 - she
   7611 - might
   7612 - be
   7613 - afraid
   7614 - of
   7615 - what
   7616 - he
   7617 - had
   7618 - become
   7619 - Either
   7620 - situation
   7621 - was
   7622 - too
   7623 - awful
   7624 - to
   7625 - contemplate
   7626 - Arthur‘s
   7627 - hesitation
   7628 - turned
   7629 - into
   7630 - a
   7631 - terrible
   7632 - fear
   7633 - and
   7634 - he
   7635 - began
   7636 - to
   7637 - back
   7638 - away
   7639 - As
   7640 - he
   7641 - did
   7642 - so
   7643 - Emily
   7644 - put
   7645 - the
   7646 - journal
   7647 - down
   7648 - and
   7649 - turned
   7650 - her
   7651 - head
   7652 - so
   7653 - that
   7654 - she
   7655 - was
   7656 - looking
   7657 - directly
   7658 - at
   7659 - him
   7660 - Arthur‘s
   7661 - eyes
   7662 - met
   7663 - Emily‘s
   7664 - but
   7665 - he
   7666 - saw
   7667 - neither
   7668 - recognition
   7669 - nor
   7670 - fear
   7671 - in
   7672 - her
   7673 - gaze
   7674 - In
   7675 - fact
   7676 - she
   7677 - looked
   7678 - right
   7679 - through
   7680 - him
   7681 - Mum
   7682 - Arthur
   7683 - said
   7684 - his
   7685 - voice
   7686 - weak
   7687 - and
   7688 - uncertain
   7689 - Emily
   7690 - didn‘t
   7691 - respond
   7692 - She
   7693 - yawned
   7694 - looked
   7695 - away
   7696 - from
   7697 - Arthur
   7698 - and
   7699 - picked
   7700 - up
   7701 - the
   7702 - journal
   7703 - again
   7704 - touching
   7705 - the
   7706 - screen
   7707 - to
   7708 - bring
   7709 - up
   7710 - a
   7711 - different
   7712 - article
   7713 - Mum
   7714 - ”
   7715 - Arthur
   7716 - walked
   7717 - right
   7718 - up
   7719 - to
   7720 - her
   7721 - and
   7722 - stood
   7723 - behind
   7724 - her
   7725 - chair
   7726 - Mum
   7727 - ”
   7728 - Emily
   7729 - didn‘t
   7730 - respond
   7731 - Arthur
   7732 - reached
   7733 - out
   7734 - to
   7735 - touch
   7736 - her
   7737 - shoulder
   7738 - but
   7739 - stopped
   7740 - an
   7741 - inch
   7742 - away
   7743 - He
   7744 - could
   7745 - feel
   7746 - a
   7747 - strange
   7748 - electric
   7749 - tingle
   7750 - in
   7751 - his
   7752 - fingers
   7753 - and
   7754 - his
   7755 - knuckles
   7756 - pulsed
   7757 - with
   7758 - the
   7759 - ache
   7760 - of
   7761 - sorcery
   7762 - Slowly
   7763 - he
   7764 - pulled
   7765 - his
   7766 - hand
   7767 - back
   7768 - He
   7769 - didn‘t
   7770 - want
   7771 - to
   7772 - accidentally
   7773 - set
   7774 - off
   7775 - a
   7776 - spell
   7777 - that
   7778 - might
   7779 - hurt
   7780 - –
   7781 - or
   7782 - even
   7783 - kill
   7784 - –
   7785 - her
   7786 - Instead
   7787 - he
   7788 - held
   7789 - his
   7790 - hand
   7791 - out
   7792 - to
   7793 - cover
   7794 - the
   7795 - screen
   7796 - of
   7797 - her
   7798 - journal
   7799 - But
   7800 - she
   7801 - kept
   7802 - reading
   7803 - as
   7804 - if
   7805 - his
   7806 - hand
   7807 - was
   7808 - simply
   7809 - not
   7810 - there
   7811 - The

   7925 - took
   7926 - his

   7928 - away

   7935 - other
   7936 - chair
   7937 - in
   7938 - the
   7939 - room
   7940 - He
   7941 - had
   7942 - felt
   7943 - so
   7944 - relieved
   7945 - to
   7946 - see
   7947 - his
   7948 - mother
   7949 - because
   7950 - he‘d
   7951 - thought
   7952 - she
   7953 - had
   7954 - somehow
   7955 - returned
   7956 - safely
   7957 - to

   7960 - Now
   7961 - that

   7984 - I‘d
   7985 - better
   7986 - have
   7987 - a
   7988 - look

   7991 - Arthur
   7992 - He
   7993 - spoke

   7996 - Emily
   7997 - didn‘t
   7998 - react
   7999 - He
   8000 - watched
   8001 - her
   8002 - for
   8003 - a
   8004 - few
   8005 - seconds
   8006 - more
   8007 - then
   8008 - got
   8009 - up
   8010 - and
   8011 - went
   8012 - downstairs
   8013 - to
   8014 - the
   8015 - kitchen
   8016 - The
   8017 - screen
   8018 - on
   8019 - the
   8020 - refrigerator
   8021 - which
   8022 - Arthur
   8023 - had
   8024 - hoped
   8025 - would
   8026 - be
   8027 - active
   8028 - so
   8029 - he
   8030 - could
   8031 - check
   8032 - the
   8033 - time
   8034 - date
   8035 - and
   8036 - any
   8037 - news
   8038 - was
   8039 - blank
   8040 - Arthur
   8041 - turned
   8042 - away
   8043 - to
   8044 - head
   8045 - over
   8046 - to
   8047 - his
   8048 - father‘s
   8049 - studio
   8050 - and
   8051 - the
   8052 - computer
   8053 - there
   8054 - but
   8055 - first
   8056 - he
   8057 - noticed
   8058 - something
   8059 - unusual
   8060 - through
   8061 - the
   8062 - kitchen
   8063 - window
   8064 - He
   8065 - should
   8066 - have
   8067 - been
   8068 - able
   8069 - to
   8070 - see
   8071 - the
   8072 - dawn
   8073 - light
   8074 - coming
   8075 - through
   8076 - but
   8077 - it
   8078 - was
   8079 - blocked
   8080 - by
   8081 - something
   8082 - green
   8083 - that
   8084 - was
   8085 - pressed
   8086 - right
   8087 - up
   8088 - against
   8089 - the
   8090 - glass
   8091 - Arthur
   8092 - went
   8093 - closer
   8094 - There
   8095 - was
   8096 - a
   8097 - bushy
   8098 - tree
   8099 - or
   8100 - perhaps
   8101 - a
   8102 - hedge
   8103 - growing
   8104 - right
   8105 - next
   8106 - to
   8107 - the
   8108 - window
   8109 - its
   8110 - foliage
   8111 - so
   8112 - thick
   8113 - that
   8114 - he
   8115 - couldn‘t
   8116 - see
   8117 - through
   8118 - it
   8119 - But
   8120 - there
   8121 - hadn‘t
   8122 - been
   8123 - a
   8124 - tree
   8125 - there
   8126 - before
   8127 - and
   8128 - in
   8129 - fact
   8130 - there
   8131 - should
   8132 - have
   8133 - been
   8134 - nothing
   8135 - but
   8136 - bare
   8137 - earth
   8138 - outside
   8139 - the
   8140 - kitchen
   8141 - because
   8142 - Bob
   8143 - hadn‘t
   8144 - got
   8145 - around
   8146 - to
   8147 - doing
   8148 - the
   8149 - landscaping
   8150 - yet
   8151 - Arthur
   8152 - went
   8153 - to
   8154 - the
   8155 - kitchen
   8156 - door
   8157 - and
   8158 - opened
   8159 - it
   8160 - The
   8161 - door
   8162 - opened
   8163 - inward
   8164 - which
   8165 - was
   8166 - just
   8167 - as
   8168 - well
   8169 - because
   8170 - there
   8171 - was
   8172 - a
   8173 - solid
   8174 - expanse
   8175 - of
   8176 - spiky
   8177 - green
   8178 - hedge
   8179 - outside
   8180 - It
   8181 - was
   8182 - so
   8183 - thick
   8184 - Arthur
   8185 - couldn‘t
   8186 - see
   8187 - through
   8188 - any
   8189 - part
   8190 - of
   8191 - it
   8192 - or
   8193 - get
   8194 - any
   8195 - idea
   8196 - of
   8197 - how
   8198 - far
   8199 - it
   8200 - extended
   8201 - One
   8202 - thing
   8203 - was
   8204 - clear
   8205 - The
   8206 - area
   8207 - around
   8208 - his
   8209 - home
   8210 - had
   8211 - been
   8212 - transformed
   8213 - and
   8214 - it
   8215 - added
   8216 - to
   8217 - Arthur‘s
   8218 - growing
   8219 - suspicion
   8220 - that
   8221 - this
   8222 - wasn‘t
   8223 - really
   8224 - his
   8225 - house
   8226 - at
   8227 - all
   8228 - He
   8229 - sat
   8230 - down
   8231 - at
   8232 - the
   8233 - kitchen
   8234 - table
   8235 - and
   8236 - took
   8237 - out
   8238 - A
   8239 - Complete
   8240 - Atlas
   8241 - of
   8242 - the
   8243 - House
   8244 - It
   8245 - looked
   8246 - like
   8247 - the
   8248 - real
   8249 - thing
   8250 - and
   8251 - Dame
   8252 - Primus
   8253 - had
   8254 - told
   8255 - him
   8256 - it
   8257 - would
   8258 - probably
   8259 - reappear
   8260 - somewhere
   8261 - near
   8262 - him
   8263 - that
   8264 - he
   8265 - should
   8266 - check
   8267 - out
   8268 - bookshelves
   8269 - There
   8270 - was
   8271 - only
   8272 - one
   8273 - way
   8274 - to
   8275 - find
   8276 - out
   8277 - and
   8278 - to
   8279 - check
   8280 - exactly
   8281 - where
   8282 - he
   8283 - was
   8284 - and
   8285 - what
   8286 - was
   8287 - going
   8288 - on
   8289 - Arthur
   8290 - laid
   8291 - the
   8292 - Atlas
   8293 - on
   8294 - the
   8295 - table
   8296 - and
   8297 - said
   8298 - I
   8299 - need
   8300 - to
   8301 - know
   8302 - where
   8303 - I
   8304 - am
   8305 - ”
   8306 - He
   8307 - was
   8308 - about
   8309 - to
   8310 - reach
   8311 - for
   8312 - his
   8313 - Keys
   8314 - to
   8315 - use
   8316 - their
   8317 - power
   8318 - to
   8319 - activate
   8320 - the
   8321 - Atlas
   8322 - but
   8323 - he
   8324 - didn‘t
   8325 - need
   8326 - them
   8327 - His
   8328 - touch
   8329 - was
   8330 - sorcerous
   8331 - enough
   8332 - The
   8333 - Atlas
   8334 - flipped
   8335 - open
   8336 - and
   8337 - grew
   8338 - until
   8339 - it
   8340 - was
   8341 - the
   8342 - size
   8343 - of
   8344 - a
   8345 - glossy
   8346 - magazine
   8347 - The
   8348 - double-page
   8349 - spread
   8350 - it
   8351 - had
   8352 - opened
   8353 - to
   8354 - was
   8355 - blank
   8356 - at
   8357 - first
   8358 - then
   8359 - writing
   8360 - began
   8361 - to
   8362 - appear
   8363 - on
   8364 - the
   8365 - left-hand
   8366 - page
   8367 - much
   8368 - slower
   8369 - than
   8370 - when
   8371 - Arthur
   8372 - had
   8373 - looked
   8374 - at
   8375 - it
   8376 - before
   8377 - It
   8378 - was
   8379 - as
   8380 - if
   8381 - the
   8382 - invisible
   8383 - hand
   8384 - was
   8385 - being
   8386 - opposed
   8387 - or
   8388 - held
   8389 - back
   8390 - in
   8391 - some
   8392 - way
   8393 - for
   8394 - the
   8395 - letters
   8396 - were
   8397 - not
   8398 - only
   8399 - slow
   8400 - to
   8401 - appear
   8402 - they
   8403 - were
   8404 - in
   8405 - an
   8406 - almost
   8407 - illegible
   8408 - scrawl
   8409 - rather
   8410 - than
   8411 - the
   8412 - beautiful
   8413 - copperplate
   8414 - writing
   8415 - the
   8416 - Atlas
   8417 - usually
   8418 - used
   8419 - Arthur
   8420 - guessed
   8421 - what
   8422 - the
   8423 - Atlas
   8424 - was
   8425 - going
   8426 - to
   8427 - say
   8428 - before
   8429 - the
   8430 - first
   8431 - word

   8441 - Incomparable
   8442 - Gardens

   8444 - asked
   8445 - Arthur
   8446 - as
   8447 - soon
   8448 - as
   8449 - the
   8450 - words
   8451 - were
   8452 - finished
   8453 - a
   8454 - long
   8455 - minute
   8456 - later
   8457 - And
   8458 - why
   8459 - are
   8460 - my
   8461 - house

   8468 - Can‘t

   8472 - Seventh
   8473 - Key…came
   8474 - the
   8475 - ever-so-slow
   8476 - reply
   8477 - The
   8478 - last
   8479 - word
   8480 - was
   8481 - almost
   8482 - unreadable
   8483 - the
   8484 - final
   8485 - letter
   8486 - not
   8487 - much
   8488 - more
   8489 - than
   8490 - a
   8491 - blob
   8492 - of
   8493 - ink
   8494 - with
   8495 - a
   8496 - downstroke
   8497 - Is
   8498 - that
   8499 - really
   8500 - Emily
   8501 - upstairs
   8502 - ”
   8503 - Arthur
   8504 - asked
   8505 - He
   8506 - focused
   8507 - his
   8508 - mind
   8509 - more
   8510 - strongly
   8511 - upon
   8512 - the
   8513 - Atlas
   8514 - and
   8515 - slipped
   8516 - his
   8517 - hands
   8518 - into
   8519 - his
   8520 - pouch
   8521 - to
   8522 - hold
   8523 - and
   8524 - draw
   8525 - on
   8526 - the
   8527 - power
   8528 - of
   8529 - both
   8530 - the
   8531 - Fifth
   8532 - and
   8533 - Sixth
   8534 - Keys
   8535 - the
   8536 - mirror
   8537 - in
   8538 - his
   8539 - left
   8540 - hand
   8541 - and
   8542 - the
   8543 - pen
   8544 - in
   8545 - his
   8546 - right
   8547 - He
   8548 - could
   8549 - feel
   8550 - something
   8551 - fighting
   8552 - back
   8553 - some
   8554 - power
   8555 - opposing
   8556 - his
   8557 - attempt
   8558 - to
   8559 - use
   8560 - the
   8561 - Atlas
   8562 - It
   8563 - was
   8564 - like
   8565 - an
   8566 - unseen
   8567 - presence
   8568 - pressing
   8569 - on
   8570 - his
   8571 - face
   8572 - trying
   8573 - to
   8574 - push
   8575 - him
   8576 - back
   8577 - from
   8578 - the
   8579 - table
   8580 - and
   8581 - the
   8582 - open
   8583 - book
   8584 - Arthur
   8585 - fought
   8586 - against
   8587 - it
   8588 - though
   8589 - he
   8590 - remembered
   8591 - Dame
   8592 - Primus
   8593 - saying
   8594 - the
   8595 - Seventh
   8596 - Key
   8597 - was
   8598 - paramount
   8599 - the
   8600 - most
   8601 - powerful
   8602 - of
   8603 - all
   8604 - and
   8605 - like
   8606 - all
   8607 - the
   8608 - Keys
   8609 - it
   8610 - was
   8611 - even
   8612 - stronger
   8613 - in
   8614 - its
   8615 - own
   8616 - demesne
   8617 - But
   8618 - surely
   8619 - he
   8620 - thought
   8621 - having
   8622 - two
   8623 - Keys
   8624 - would
   8625 - enable
   8626 - him
   8627 - to
   8628 - have
   8629 - some
   8630 - chance
   8631 - against
   8632 - it
   8633 - The
   8634 - Atlas
   8635 - slowly
   8636 - wrote
   8637 - a
   8638 - single
   8639 - misshapen
   8640 - letter
   8641 - Arthur
   8642 - couldn‘t
   8643 - quite
   8644 - figure
   8645 - it
   8646 - out
   8647 - for
   8648 - a
   8649 - moment
   8650 - till
   8651 - he
   8652 - turned
   8653 - his
   8654 - head
   8655 - slightly
   8656 - and
   8657 - saw
   8658 - it
   8659 - was
   8660 - a
   8661 - Y
   8662 - that
   8663 - was
   8664 - partly
   8665 - rotated
   8666 - followed
   8667 - very
   8668 - slowly
   8669 - by
   8670 - two
   8671 - more
   8672 - letters
   8673 - Yes
   8674 - read
   8675 - Arthur
   8676 - aloud
   8677 - But
   8678 - the
   8679 - Atlas
   8680 - kept
   8681 - writing
   8682 - Another
   8683 - word
   8684 - appeared
   8685 - each
   8686 - letter
   8687 - painstakingly
   8688 - spelled
   8689 - out
   8690 - over
   8691 - several
   8692 - seconds
   8693 - And
   8694 - read
   8695 - Arthur
   8696 - and
   8697 - then
   8698 - no
   8699 - ”
   8700 - Yes
   8701 - and
   8702 - no
   8703 - How
   8704 - can
   8705 - it
   8706 - be
   8707 - yes
   8708 - and
   8709 - no
   8710 - ”
   8711 - Arthur
   8712 - asked
   8713 - angrily
   8714 - He
   8715 - felt
   8716 - rage
   8717 - build
   8718 - up
   8719 - inside
   8720 - him
   8721 - How
   8722 - dare
   8723 - this
   8724 - ineffectual
   8725 - Atlas
   8726 - be
   8727 - so
   8728 - slow
   8729 - and
   8730 - so
   8731 - inexact
   8732 - I
   8733 - must
   8734 - have
   8735 - the
   8736 - answer
   8737 - ”
   8738 - shouted
   8739 - Arthur
   8740 - He
   8741 - thumped
   8742 - the
   8743 - table
   8744 - with
   8745 - the
   8746 - Keys
   8747 - and
   8748 - thought
   8749 - furiously
   8750 - at
   8751 - the
   8752 - Atlas
   8753 - What
   8754 - do
   8755 - you
   8756 - mean
   8757 - yes
   8758 - and
   8759 - no
   8760 - But
   8761 - the
   8762 - Atlas
   8763 - wrote
   8764 - no
   8765 - more
   8766 - and
   8767 - Arthur
   8768 - felt
   8769 - the
   8770 - power
   8771 - that
   8772 - opposed
   8773 - him
   8774 - grow
   8775 - stronger
   8776 - It
   8777 - kept
   8778 - pushing
   8779 - at
   8780 - his
   8781 - face
   8782 - and
   8783 - he
   8784 - found
   8785 - himself
   8786 - turning
   8787 - his
   8788 - head
   8789 - unable
   8790 - to
   8791 - keep
   8792 - looking
   8793 - at
   8794 - the
   8795 - Atlas
   8796 - no
   8797 - matter
   8798 - how
   8799 - hard
   8800 - he
   8801 - tried
   8802 - Then
   8803 - with
   8804 - a
   8805 - crack
   8806 - his
   8807 - head
   8808 - snapped
   8809 - round
   8810 - past
   8811 - his
   8812 - left
   8813 - shoulder
   8814 - and
   8815 - with
   8816 - a
   8817 - snap
   8818 - that
   8819 - was
   8820 - almost
   8821 - as
   8822 - loud
   8823 - the
   8824 - Atlas
   8825 - shut
   8826 - itself
   8827 - and
   8828 - returned
   8829 - to
   8830 - its
   8831 - normal
   8832 - size
   8833 - Arthur
   8834 - growled
   8835 - His
   8836 - vision
   8837 - was
   8838 - washed
   8839 - with
   8840 - red
   8841 - a
   8842 - red
   8843 - that
   8844 - pulsed
   8845 - with
   8846 - his
   8847 - rapidly
   8848 - beating
   8849 - heart
   8850 - He
   8851 - lost
   8852 - conscious
   8853 - thought
   8854 - In
   8855 - one
   8856 - second
   8857 - he
   8858 - was
   8859 - sitting
   8860 - at
   8861 - the
   8862 - table
   8863 - the
   8864 - rage
   8865 - building
   8866 - inside
   8867 - him
   8868 - In
   8869 - what
   8870 - felt
   8871 - like
   8872 - the
   8873 - next
   8874 - second
   8875 - he
   8876 - found
   8877 - himself
   8878 - standing
   8879 - above
   8880 - the
   8881 - wreckage
   8882 - of
   8883 - the
   8884 - table
   8885 - his
   8886 - hands
   8887 - balled
   8888 - into
   8889 - fists
   8890 - with
   8891 - splinters
   8892 - of
   8893 - wood
   8894 - sticking
   8895 - out
   8896 - from
   8897 - his
   8898 - knuckles
   8899 - The
   8900 - Atlas
   8901 - undamaged
   8902 - lay
   8903 - on
   8904 - top
   8905 - of
   8906 - the
   8907 - broken
   8908 - pile
   8909 - of
   8910 - wood
   8911 - Arthur
   8912 - stared
   8913 - at
   8914 - it
   8915 - and
   8916 - the
   8917 - splintered
   8918 - timber
   8919 - He
   8920 - was
   8921 - shocked
   8922 - by
   8923 - what
   8924 - he
   8925 - had
   8926 - done
   8927 - for
   8928 - the
   8929 - table
   8930 - had
   8931 - been
   8932 - old
   8933 - and
   8934 - immensely
   8935 - solid
   8936 - and
   8937 - could
   8938 - not
   8939 - have
   8940 - been
   8941 - smashed
   8942 - by
   8943 - even
   8944 - the
   8945 - strongest
   8946 - of
   8947 - men
   8948 - without
   8949 - a
   8950 - sledgehammer
   8951 - He
   8952 - was
   8953 - even
   8954 - more
   8955 - shocked
   8956 - by
   8957 - the
   8958 - fact
   8959 - that
   8960 - he
   8961 - had
   8962 - done
   8963 - it
   8964 - involuntarily
   8965 - that
   8966 - the
   8967 - rage
   8968 - had
   8969 - been
   8970 - so
   8971 - strong
   8972 - he
   8973 - had
   8974 - lashed
   8975 - out
   8976 - without
   8977 - his
   8978 - conscious
   8979 - mind
   8980 - even
   8981 - being
   8982 - aware
   8983 - of
   8984 - it
   8985 - The
   8986 - anger
   8987 - was
   8988 - still
   8989 - there
   8990 - smoldering
   8991 - away
   8992 - like
   8993 - a
   8994 - fire
   8995 - that
   8996 - needed
   8997 - only
   8998 - the
   8999 - merest
   9000 - breath
   9001 - to
   9002 - make
   9003 - it
   9004 - blaze
   9005 - again
   9006 - It
   9007 - scared
   9008 - him
   9009 - because
   9010 - it
   9011 - came
   9012 - out
   9013 - of
   9014 - nowhere
   9015 - and
   9016 - was
   9017 - so
   9018 - powerful
   9019 - He
   9020 - had
   9021 - never
   9022 - been
   9023 - like
   9024 - this
   9025 - before
   9026 - He
   9027 - was
   9028 - not
   9029 - an
   9030 - angry
   9031 - person
   9032 - Or
   9033 - at
   9034 - least
   9035 - he
   9036 - had
   9037 - not
   9038 - been
   9039 - before
   9040 - he
   9041 - became
   9042 - the
   9043 - Rightful
   9044 - Heir
   9045 - Once
   9046 - again
   9047 - as
   9048 - he
   9049 - had
   9050 - thought
   9051 - so
   9052 - often
   9053 - he
   9054 - wished
   9055 - he
   9056 - had
   9057 - not
   9058 - been
   9059 - chosen
   9060 - by
   9061 - the
   9062 - Will
   9063 - to
   9064 - be
   9065 - the
   9066 - Heir
   9067 - even
   9068 - though
   9069 - it
   9070 - had
   9071 - told
   9072 - him
   9073 - he
   9074 - would
   9075 - otherwise
   9076 - have
   9077 - died
   9078 - from
   9079 - an
   9080 - asthma
   9081 - attack
   9082 - That
   9083 - was
   9084 - the
   9085 - only
   9086 - reason
   9087 - he‘d
   9088 - been
   9089 - chosen
   9090 - or
   9091 - so
   9092 - the
   9093 - Will
   9094 - had
   9095 - said
   9096 - It
   9097 - had
   9098 - wanted
   9099 - a
   9100 - mortal
   9101 - and
   9102 - one
   9103 - who
   9104 - was
   9105 - about
   9106 - to
   9107 - die
   9108 - Arthur
   9109 - shivered
   9110 - and
   9111 - forced
   9112 - himself
   9113 - to
   9114 - take
   9115 - a
   9116 - long
   9117 - slow
   9118 - breath
   9119 - He
   9120 - counted
   9121 - to
   9122 - six
   9123 - as
   9124 - he
   9125 - breathed
   9126 - in
   9127 - and
   9128 - to
   9129 - six
   9130 - as
   9131 - he
   9132 - exhaled
   9133 - As
   9134 - he
   9135 - did
   9136 - so
   9137 - he
   9138 - felt
   9139 - the
   9140 - rage
   9141 - diminish
   9142 - He
   9143 - tried
   9144 - to
   9145 - visualize
   9146 - it
   9147 - being
   9148 - forced
   9149 - back
   9150 - into
   9151 - a
   9152 - small
   9153 - locked
   9154 - box
   9155 - from
   9156 - which
   9157 - it
   9158 - could
   9159 - not
   9160 - emerge
   9161 - without
   9162 - him
   9163 - consciously
   9164 - releasing
   9165 - it
   9166 - After
   9167 - a
   9168 - few
   9169 - minutes
   9170 - he
   9171 - felt
   9172 - slightly
   9173 - calmer
   9174 - again
   9175 - and
   9176 - was
   9177 - able
   9178 - to
   9179 - think
   9180 - about
   9181 - what
   9182 - was
   9183 - going
   9184 - on
   9185 - OK
   9186 - I‘m
   9187 - in
   9188 - some
   9189 - part
   9190 - of
   9191 - the
   9192 - Incomparable
   9193 - Gardens
   9194 - I
   9195 - need
   9196 - to
   9197 - get
   9198 - out
   9199 - get
   9200 - back
   9201 - to
   9202 - the
   9203 - Great
   9204 - Maze
   9205 - and
   9206 - rally
   9207 - the
   9208 - Army
   9209 - of
   9210 - the
   9211 - Architect
   9212 - to
   9213 - invade
   9214 - the
   9215 - Upper
   9216 - House
   9217 - Arthur
   9218 - stopped
   9219 - in
   9220 - mid-thought
   9221 - That
   9222 - was
   9223 - what
   9224 - Part
   9225 - Six
   9226 - of
   9227 - the
   9228 - Will
   9229 - had
   9230 - suggested
   9231 - but
   9232 - perhaps
   9233 - that
   9234 - wasn‘t
   9235 - the
   9236 - best
   9237 - course
   9238 - of
   9239 - action
   9240 - Dame
   9241 - Primus
   9242 - and
   9243 - Sir
   9244 - Thursday‘s
   9245 - Marshals
   9246 - could
   9247 - get
   9248 - the
   9249 - Army
   9250 - organized
   9251 - without
   9252 - him
   9253 - and
   9254 - whatever
   9255 - might
   9256 - be
   9257 - the
   9258 - outcome
   9259 - of
   9260 - any
   9261 - battle
   9262 - he
   9263 - would
   9264 - still
   9265 - need
   9266 - to
   9267 - find
   9268 - Part
   9269 - Seven
   9270 - of
   9271 - the
   9272 - Will
   9273 - and
   9274 - release
   9275 - it
   9276 - Then
   9277 - with
   9278 - its
   9279 - help
   9280 - he
   9281 - could
   9282 - force
   9283 - Sunday
   9284 - to
   9285 - give
   9286 - up
   9287 - the
   9288 - Seventh
   9289 - Key
   9290 - With
   9291 - that
   9292 - in
   9293 - his
   9294 - possession
   9295 - it
   9296 - wouldn‘t
   9297 - matter
   9298 - if
   9299 - Saturday
   9300 - or
   9301 - the
   9302 - Piper
   9303 - conquered
   9304 - the
   9305 - Incomparable
   9306 - Gardens
   9307 - With
   9308 - all
   9309 - Seven
   9310 - Keys
   9311 - Arthur
   9312 - could
   9313 - defeat
   9314 - any
   9315 - opposition
   9316 - And
   9317 - more
   9318 - important
   9319 - he
   9320 - could
   9321 - stop
   9322 - the
   9323 - tide
   9324 - of
   9325 - Nothing
   9326 - that
   9327 - was
   9328 - destroying
   9329 - the
   9330 - House
   9331 - All
   9332 - I
   9333 - have
   9334 - to
   9335 - do
   9336 - is
   9337 - find
   9338 - the
   9339 - Will
   9340 - thought
   9341 - Arthur
   9342 - with
   9343 - sudden
   9344 - clarity
   9345 - I‘ve
   9346 - done
   9347 - it
   9348 - before
   9349 - I
   9350 - can
   9351 - do
   9352 - it
   9353 - here
   9354 - I‘m
   9355 - attuned
   9356 - to
   9357 - the
   9358 - Will
   9359 - I
   9360 - am
   9361 - in
   9362 - the
   9363 - Incomparable
   9364 - Gardens
   9365 - and
   9366 - it
   9367 - is
   9368 - supposed
   9369 - to
   9370 - be
   9371 - here
   9372 - somewhere
   9373 - I‘ll
   9374 - just
   9375 - focus
   9376 - my
   9377 - mind
   9378 - on
   9379 - it
   9380 - and
   9381 - it
   9382 - will
   9383 - tell
   9384 - me
   9385 - where
   9386 - it
   9387 - is
   9388 - While
   9389 - this
   9390 - was
   9391 - the
   9392 - most
   9393 - prominent
   9394 - thought
   9395 - in
   9396 - Arthur‘s
   9397 - mind
   9398 - another
   9399 - small
   9400 - part
   9401 - was
   9402 - not
   9403 - so
   9404 - sure
   9405 - As
   9406 - he
   9407 - tried
   9408 - to
   9409 - focus
   9410 - his
   9411 - thoughts
   9412 - on
   9413 - where
   9414 - Part
   9415 - Seven
   9416 - of
   9417 - the
   9418 - Will
   9419 - might
   9420 - be
   9421 - a
   9422 - good
   9423 - portion
   9424 - of
   9425 - his
   9426 - subconscious
   9427 - was
   9428 - also
   9429 - trying
   9430 - to
   9431 - tell
   9432 - him
   9433 - that
   9434 - this
   9435 - might
   9436 - not
   9437 - be
   9438 - a
   9439 - good
   9440 - idea
   9441 - that
   9442 - it
   9443 - might
   9444 - even
   9445 - alert
   9446 - Lord
   9447 - Sunday
   9448 - to
   9449 - his
   9450 - presence
   9451 - and
   9452 - that
   9453 - despite
   9454 - the
   9455 - two
   9456 - Keys
   9457 - he
   9458 - held
   9459 - and
   9460 - the
   9461 - overconfidence
   9462 - they
   9463 - had
   9464 - engendered
   9465 - in
   9466 - him
   9467 - Lord
   9468 - Sunday
   9469 - and
   9470 - the
   9471 - Seventh
   9472 - Key
   9473 - would
   9474 - probably
   9475 - make
   9476 - very
   9477 - short
   9478 - work
   9479 - of
   9480 - Arthur
   9481 - especially
   9482 - an
   9483 - Arthur
   9484 - who
   9485 - was
   9486 - without
   9487 - allies
   9488 - of
   9489 - any
   9490 - kind
   9491 - But
   9492 - the
   9493 - angry
   9494 - triumphant
   9495 - Arthur
   9496 - was
   9497 - more
   9498 - powerful
   9499 - He
   9500 - bent
   9501 - his
   9502 - mind
   9503 - on
   9504 - reaching
   9505 - Part
   9506 - Seven
   9507 - of
   9508 - the
   9509 - Will
   9510 - He
   9511 - was
   9512 - just
   9513 - thinking
   9514 - he
   9515 - felt
   9516 - some
   9517 - feeble
   9518 - touch
   9519 - from
   9520 - it
   9521 - when
   9522 - the
   9523 - green
   9524 - hedge
   9525 - suddenly
   9526 - shivered
   9527 - and
   9528 - split
   9529 - apart
   9530 - A
   9531 - boy
   9532 - –
   9533 - a
   9534 - Piper‘s
   9535 - child
   9536 - –
   9537 - stepped
   9538 - through
   9539 - the
   9540 - gap
   9541 - and
   9542 - without
   9543 - a
   9544 - word
   9545 - of
   9546 - warning
   9547 - lunged
   9548 - at
   9549 - Arthur
   9550 - with
   9551 - a
   9552 - six-foot-long
   9553 - three-tined
   9554 - gardening
   9555 - fork
   9556 - each
   9557 - of

   9715 - at
   9716 - Friday‘s
   9717 - private
   9718 - hospital
   9719 - It
   9720 - would
   9721 - have
   9722 - been
   9723 - bad
   9724 - enough
   9725 - for

   9727 - on

   9746 - by
   9747 - Lady
   9748 - Friday
   9749 - who

   9753 - harvest
   9754 - their
   9755 - memories
   9756 - After
   9757 - Friday‘s
   9758 - defeat
   9759 - Leaf
   9760 - had
   9761 - shepherded
   9762 - the

   9764 - back
   9765 - from
   9766 - Friday‘s
   9767 - otherworldly
   9768 - lair
   9769 - only
   9770 - to

   9772 - of
   9773 - the
   9774 - impending
   9775 - nuclear
   9776 - strike
   9777 - and
   9778 - then
   9779 - as
   9780 - Arthur‘s
   9781 - time
   9782 - stop
   9783 - had
   9784 - begun
   9785 - to
   9786 - wear
   9787 - off
   9788 - she‘d
   9789 - had
   9790 - to

   9792 - a
   9793 - frantic
   9794 - and
   9795 - not
   9796 - entirely
   9797 - successful
   9798 - attempt

   9800 - move
   9801 - everyone
   9802 - to
   9803 - the
   9804 - underground
   9805 - level
   9806 - Though
   9807 - Friday‘s
   9808 - building
   9809 - was
   9810 - less
   9811 - than
   9812 - a
   9813 - mile
   9814 - from
   9815 - East
   9816 - Area
   9817 - Hospital
   9818 - there
   9819 - was
   9820 - a
   9821 - slight
   9822 - hill
   9823 - between
   9824 - them
   9825 - and
   9826 - it
   9827 - had
   9828 - also
   9829 - been
   9830 - shielded
   9831 - by
   9832 - a
   9833 - taller
   9834 - very
   9835 - solid
   9836 - warehouse
   9837 - building
   9838 - so
   9839 - it
   9840 - had
   9841 - not
   9842 - been
   9843 - badly
   9844 - damaged
   9845 - by
   9846 - the
   9847 - explosive
   9848 - force
   9849 - of
   9850 - the
   9851 - micronukes
   9852 - However
   9853 - there
   9854 - had
   9855 - been
   9856 - small
   9857 - fires
   9858 - all
   9859 - around
   9860 - the
   9861 - outside
   9862 - and
   9863 - everything
   9864 - was
   9865 - contaminated
   9866 - by
   9867 - radiation
   9868 - –
   9869 - though
   9870 - no
   9871 - one
   9872 - knew
   9873 - how
   9874 - bad
   9875 - the
   9876 - contamination
   9877 - was
   9878 - and
   9879 - Leaf
   9880 - hadn‘t
   9881 - been
   9882 - able
   9883 - to
   9884 - find
   9885 - out
   9886 - To
   9887 - make
   9888 - the
   9889 - situation
   9890 - even
   9891 - more
   9892 - difficult
   9893 - all
   9894 - the
   9895 - sleepers
   9896 - had
   9897 - woken
   9898 - up
   9899 - over
   9900 - the
   9901 - course
   9902 - of
   9903 - the
   9904 - Saturday
   9905 - morning
   9906 - and
   9907 - were
   9908 - badly
   9909 - disoriented
   9910 - and
   9911 - often
   9912 - wanted
   9913 - to
   9914 - just
   9915 - get
   9916 - up
   9917 - and
   9918 - get
   9919 - out
   9920 - This
   9921 - was
   9922 - double
   9923 - trouble
   9924 - because
   9925 - all
   9926 - the
   9927 - doors
   9928 - needed
   9929 - to
   9930 - be
   9931 - kept
   9932 - shut
   9933 - to
   9934 - keep
   9935 - radioactive
   9936 - particles
   9937 - out
   9938 - as
   9939 - much
   9940 - as
   9941 - the
   9942 - sleepers
   9943 - inside
   9944 - An
   9945 - hour
   9946 - or
   9947 - so
   9948 - after
   9949 - the
   9950 - nuclear
   9951 - strike
   9952 - special
   9953 - fire
   9954 - trucks
   9955 - had
   9956 - rumbled
   9957 - in
   9958 - and
   9959 - put
   9960 - out
   9961 - the
   9962 - spot
   9963 - fires
   9964 - with
   9965 - their
   9966 - water
   9967 - and
   9968 - foam
   9969 - cannons
   9970 - though
   9971 - no
   9972 - fire-fighters
   9973 - got
   9974 - out
   9975 - of
   9976 - the
   9977 - vehicles
   9978 - They
   9979 - were
   9980 - followed
   9981 - by
   9982 - armored
   9983 - personnel
   9984 - carriers
   9985 - that
   9986 - drove
   9987 - up
   9988 - and
   9989 - down
   9990 - the
   9991 - streets
   9992 - their
   9993 - external
   9994 - bullhorns
   9995 - loudly
   9996 - crackling
   9997 - with
   9998 - instructions
   9999 - to
  10000 - civilians
  10001 - to
  10002 - stay
  10003 - inside
  10004 - keep
  10005 - doors
  10006 - and
  10007 - windows
  10008 - sealed
  10009 - and
  10010 - stand
  10011 - by
  10012 - for
  10013 - further
  10014 - orders
  10015 - Those
  10016 - further
  10017 - orders
  10018 - had
  10019 - come
  10020 - on
  10021 - Saturday
  10022 - night
  10023 - with
  10024 - designated
  10025 - aid
  10026 - stations
  10027 - to
  10028 - be
  10029 - opened
  10030 - the
  10031 - next
  10032 - morning
  10033 - to
  10034 - issue
  10035 - water
  10036 - food
  10037 - and
  10038 - medication
  10039 - Every
  10040 - household
  10041 - had

  10043 - told
  10044 - to
  10045 - send
  10046 - one
  10047 - member
  10048 - and
  10049 - warnings
  10050 - were
  10051 - issued
  10052 - about
  10053 - wearing
  10054 - gloves
  10055 - a
  10056 - face
  10057 - mask
  10058 - of
  10059 - some
  10060 - kind
  10061 - and
  10062 - a
  10063 - coat
  10064 - that
  10065 - could
  10066 - be
  10067 - discarded
  10068 - before
  10069 - going
  10070 - back
  10071 - inside
  10072 - Leaf
  10073 - had
  10074 - come
  10075 - out
  10076 - to
  10077 - get
  10078 - help
  10079 - for
  10080 - the
  10081 - sleepers
  10082 - who
  10083 - included
  10084 - her
  10085 - Aunt
  10086 - Mango
  10087 - Lady
  10088 - Friday
  10089 - had
  10090 - never
  10091 - intended
  10092 - that
  10093 - her
  10094 - private
  10095 - hospital
  10096 - would
  10097 - actually
  10098 - cater
  10099 - to
  10100 - live
  10101 - patients
  10102 - so
  10103 - there
  10104 - was
  10105 - very
  10106 - little
  10107 - food
  10108 - or
  10109 - medicine
  10110 - and
  10111 - the
  10112 - only
  10113 - water
  10114 - they
  10115 - knew
  10116 - was
  10117 - not
  10118 - contaminated
  10119 - came
  10120 - from
  10121 - a
  10122 - single
  10123 - water
  10124 - cooler
  10125 - barrel
  10126 - that
  10127 - had
  10128 - been
  10129 - in
  10130 - the
  10131 - front
  10132 - office
  10133 - and
  10134 - that
  10135 - had
  10136 - only
  10137 - been
  10138 - enough
  10139 - for
  10140 - the
  10141 - merest
  10142 - sip
  10143 - when
  10144 - shared
  10145 - among
  10146 - so
  10147 - many
  10148 - people
  10149 - Leaf
  10150 - ran
  10151 - her
  10152 - tongue
  10153 - around
  10154 - the
  10155 - inside
  10156 - of
  10157 - her
  10158 - dry
  10159 - mouth
  10160 - as
  10161 - she
  10162 - thought
  10163 - of
  10164 - that
  10165 - water
  10166 - barrel
  10167 - She
  10168 - could
  10169 - see
  10170 - people
  10171 - ahead
  10172 - of
  10173 - her
  10174 - in
  10175 - the
  10176 - line
  10177 - coming
  10178 - back
  10179 - carrying
  10180 - big
  10181 - sealed
  10182 - containers
  10183 - of
  10184 - water
  10185 - and
  10186 - Army-issue
  10187 - backpacks
  10188 - that
  10189 - were
  10190 - presumably
  10191 - stuffed
  10192 - with
  10193 - food
  10194 - and
  10195 - medicine
  10196 - She‘d
  10197 - tried
  10198 - to
  10199 - explain
  10200 - to
  10201 - one
  10202 - of
  10203 - the
  10204 - soldiers
  10205 - standing
  10206 - guard
  10207 - that
  10208 - she
  10209 - wasn‘t
  10210 - from
  10211 - a
  10212 - normal
  10213 - house
  10214 - and
  10215 - needed
  10216 - more
  10217 - help
  10218 - but
  10219 - he‘d
  10220 - refused
  10221 - to
  10222 - listen
  10223 - and
  10224 - told
  10225 - her
  10226 - to
  10227 - join
  10228 - the
  10229 - queue
  10230 - She‘d
  10231 - tried
  10232 - to
  10233 - argue
  10234 - but
  10235 - he
  10236 - had
  10237 - leveled
  10238 - his
  10239 - assault
  10240 - rifle
  10241 - at
  10242 - her
  10243 - and
  10244 - told
  10245 - her
  10246 - again
  10247 - to
  10248 - get
  10249 - in
  10250 - line
  10251 - His
  10252 - voice
  10253 - through
  10254 - his
  10255 - gas
  10256 - mask
  10257 - had
  10258 - sounded
  10259 - nervous
  10260 - so
  10261 - she‘d
  10262 - backed
  10263 - off
  10264 - It
  10265 - had
  10266 - meant
  10267 - an
  10268 - hour‘s
  10269 - wait
  10270 - but
  10271 - she
  10272 - was
  10273 - almost
  10274 - up
  10275 - to
  10276 - the
  10277 - desk
  10278 - where
  10279 - two
  10280 - more
  10281 - soldiers
  10282 - bulky
  10283 - and
  10284 - strange
  10285 - in
  10286 - their
  10287 - biohazard
  10288 - suits
  10289 - were
  10290 - checking
  10291 - people
  10292 - off
  10293 - before
  10294 - they

  13604 - just

  13638 - Phineas
  13639 - He
  13640 - frowned

  13643 - Least
  13644 - I
  13645 - couldn‘t
  13646 - You‘re
  13647 - powerful

  13651 - bring
  13652 - her
  13653 - into
  13654 - our
  13655 - time
  13656 - but
  13657 - that

  13662 - I
  13663 - suppose

  13666 - Arthur
  13667 - thoughtfully
  13668 - He
  13669 - was
  13670 - wondering

  13674 - make
  13675 - Emily
  13676 - fall

  13685 - and

  13687 - her
  13688 - home…except
  13689 - the
  13690 - house
  13691 - would
  13692 - still
  13693 - be
  13694 - here
  13695 - Perhaps
  13696 - if

  13698 - just

  13710 - if
  13711 - our
  13712 - place
  13713 - has
  13714 - disappeared

  13716 - would
  13717 - be
  13718 - better
  13719 - to

  13721 - her
  13722 - back
  13723 - to
  13724 - Earth—

  14624 - that
  14625 - wavered
  14626 - and

  14628 - felt
  14629 - a
  14630 - surge

  14696 - continued
  14697 - to
  14698 - shake
  14699 - and
  14700 - twist
  14701 - as
  14702 - if
  14703 - someone
  14704 - else
  14705 - was
  14706 - trying
  14707 - to
  14708 - take
  14709 - it
  14710 - away
  14711 - from
  14712 - him
  14713 - Steady
  14714 - ”
  14715 - hissed
  14716 - Arthur
  14717 - exerting
  14718 - his
  14719 - willpower
  14720 - to
  14721 - keep
  14722 - the
  14723 - mirror
  14724 - still
  14725 - and
  14726 - the
  14727 - scene
  14728 - in
  14729 - view
  14730 - But
  14731 - just
  14732 - as
  14733 - he
  14734 - had
  14735 - with
  14736 - the
  14737 - Atlas
  14738 - he
  14739 - felt
  14740 - an
  14741 - opposing
  14742 - force
  14743 - one
  14744 - that
  14745 - grew
  14746 - stronger
  14747 - and
  14748 - stronger
  14749 - until
  14750 - the
  14751 - Fifth
  14752 - Key
  14753 - flew
  14754 - from
  14755 - his
  14756 - grasp
  14757 - and
  14758 - clattered
  14759 - on
  14760 - to
  14761 - the
  14762 - floor
  14763 - Arthur
  14764 - clenched
  14765 - his
  14766 - fist
  14767 - but
  14768 - seeing
  14769 - Phineas
  14770 - watching
  14771 - him
  14772 - so
  14773 - intently
  14774 - he
  14775 - managed
  14776 - to
  14777 - contain
  14778 - his
  14779 - anger
  14780 - Instead
  14781 - of
  14782 - punching
  14783 - the
  14784 - walls
  14785 - he
  14786 - knelt
  14787 - down
  14788 - and
  14789 - picked
  14790 - up
  14791 - the
  14792 - mirror
  14793 - slipping
  14794 - it
  14795 - back
  14796 - into
  14797 - his
  14798 - pouch
  14799 - Maybe
  14800 - I
  14801 - won‘t
  14802 - be
  14803 - going
  14804 - after
  14805 - all
  14806 - he
  14807 - said
  14808 - How
  14809 - do
  14810 - we
  14811 - get
  14812 - out
  14813 - of
  14814 - here
  14815 - ”
  14816 - Through
  14817 - the
  14818 - hedge
  14819 - said
  14820 - Phineas
  14821 - It‘ll
  14822 - open
  14823 - for
  14824 - me
  14825 - being
  14826 - a
  14827 - Gardener
  14828 - and
  14829 - all
  14830 - Just
  14831 - stay
  14832 - close
  14833 - behind
  14834 - ”
  14835 - He
  14836 - touched
  14837 - the
  14838 - hedge
  14839 - that
  14840 - blocked
  14841 - the
  14842 - kitchen
  14843 - door
  14844 - and
  14845 - a
  14846 - boy-sized
  14847 - hole
  14848 - opened
  14849 - in
  14850 - the
  14851 - greenery

  14853 - on
  14854 - bigger
  14855 - than
  14856 - that
  14857 - ”
  14858 - said
  14859 - Phineas
  14860 - The
  14861 - hole
  14862 - grew
  14863 - large
  14864 - enough
  14865 - for
  14866 - Arthur
  14867 - Phineas
  14868 - put
  14869 - one
  14870 - leg
  14871 - through
  14872 - it
  14873 - then
  14874 - hopped
  14875 - back
  14876 - again
  14877 - My
  14878 - fork
  14879 - Can
  14880 - I
  14881 - have
  14882 - it
  14883 - back
  14884 - please
  14885 - sir
  14886 - ”
  14887 - Yes
  14888 - said
  14889 - Arthur
  14890 - Do
  14891 - you
  14892 - want
  14893 - it
  14894 - lit
  14895 - ”
  14896 - Oh
  14897 - that‘s
  14898 - all
  14899 - right
  14900 - said
  14901 - Phineas
  14902 - I‘ll
  14903 - swap
  14904 - it
  14905 - for
  14906 - another
  14907 - one
  14908 - I
  14909 - just
  14910 - have
  14911 - to
  14912 - have
  14913 - one
  14914 - to
  14915 - hand
  14916 - in
  14917 - ”
  14918 - He
  14919 - climbed
  14920 - through
  14921 - the
  14922 - hole
  14923 - Arthur
  14924 - looked
  14925 - around
  14926 - the
  14927 - kitchen
  14928 - and
  14929 - glanced
  14930 - up
  14931 - at
  14932 - the
  14933 - ceiling
  14934 - to
  14935 - the
  14936 - room
  14937 - above
  14938 - where
  14939 - his
  14940 - mother
  14941 - was
  14942 - trapped
  14943 - in
  14944 - a
  14945 - small
  14946 - circuit
  14947 - of
  14948 - time
  14949 - At
  14950 - least
  14951 - I
  14952 - know
  14953 - where
  14954 - Mum
  14955 - is
  14956 - he
  14957 - thought
  14958 - heavily
  14959 - then
  14960 - stepped
  14961 - through
  14962 - the
  14963 - hedge
  14964 - He
  14965 - found
  14966 - himself
  14967 - in
  14968 - a
  14969 - cool
  14970 - green
  14971 - alley
  14972 - between
  14973 - two
  14974 - hedges
  14975 - that
  14976 - were
  14977 - at
  14978 - least
  14979 - fifty
  14980 - feet
  14981 - tall
  14982 - Above
  14983 - them
  14984 - he
  14985 - could
  14986 - see
  14987 - a
  14988 - perfect
  14989 - blue
  14990 - sky
  14991 - with
  14992 - a
  14993 - faint
  14994 - touch
  14995 - of
  14996 - white
  14997 - clouds
  14998 - –
  14999 - it
  15000 - looked
  15001 - like
  15002 - it
  15003 - might
  15004 - have
  15005 - been
  15006 - painted
  15007 - by
  15008 - some
  15009 - old
  15010 - master
  15011 - and
  15012 - possibly
  15013 - was
  15014 - He
  15015 - couldn‘t
  15016 - see
  15017 - a
  15018 - sun
  15019 - but
  15020 - there
  15021 - was
  15022 - a
  15023 - source
  15024 - of
  15025 - illumination
  15026 - somewhere
  15027 - above
  15028 - for
  15029 - the
  15030 - sky
  15031 - was
  15032 - very
  15033 - light
  15034 - Probably
  15035 - the
  15036 - sun
  15037 - moved
  15038 - along
  15039 - a
  15040 - track
  15041 - just
  15042 - like
  15043 - the
  15044 - suns
  15045 - in
  15046 - other
  15047 - parts
  15048 - of
  15049 - the
  15050 - House
  15051 - though
  15052 - Arthur
  15053 - guessed
  15054 - that
  15055 - the
  15056 - one
  15057 - here
  15058 - would
  15059 - be
  15060 - more
  15061 - impressive
  15062 - and
  15063 - move
  15064 - more
  15065 - smoothly
  15066 - than
  15067 - in
  15068 - any
  15069 - other
  15070 - demesne
  15071 - Which
  15072 - way

  15074 - asked
  15075 - Arthur
  15076 - Left
  15077 - or
  15078 - right
  15079 - ”
  15080 - Oh
  15081 - this
  15082 - way
  15083 - said
  15084 - Phineas
  15085 - pointing
  15086 - with
  15087 - his
  15088 - fork
  15089 - Four
  15090 - hedge
  15091 - junctions
  15092 - this
  15093 - way
  15094 - then
  15095 - we
  15096 - take
  15097 - a
  15098 - left
  15099 - go
  15100 - three
  15101 - junctions
  15102 - take
  15103 - a
  15104 - right
  15105 - two
  15106 - junctions
  15107 - left
  15108 - again
  15109 - straight
  15110 - on
  15111 - past
  15112 - four
  15113 - junctions
  15114 - and
  15115 - then
  15116 - through
  15117 - another
  15118 - hedge
  15119 - and
  15120 - we‘ll
  15121 - be
  15122 - at
  15123 - the
  15124 - Garden
  15125 - Path
  15126 - which
  15127 - the
  15128 - dragonflies
  15129 - fly
  15130 - along
  15131 - all
  15132 - the
  15133 - time
  15134 - and
  15135 - sometimes
  15136 - the
  15137 - guard
  15138 - beetles
  15139 - run
  15140 - along
  15141 - though
  15142 - you
  15143 - wouldn‘t
  15144 - be
  15145 - scared
  15146 - of
  15147 - them

  15149 - Arthur
  15150 - thought
  15151 - of
  15152 - the
  15153 - beetles
  15154 - he‘d
  15155 - seen
  15156 - fighting
  15157 - Lady
  15158 - Friday‘s
  15159 - forces
  15160 - He‘d
  15161 - almost
  15162 - been
  15163 - bitten
  15164 - in
  15165 - half
  15166 - by
  15167 - one
  15168 - himself
  15169 - How
  15170 - many
  15171 - beetles
  15172 - and
  15173 - how
  15174 - often
  15175 - do
  15176 - they
  15177 - go
  15178 - along
  15179 - this
  15180 - path

  15182 - Oh
  15183 - half
  15184 - a
  15185 - dozen
  15186 - at
  15187 - a
  15188 - time

  15190 - guess

  15192 - Phineas
  15193 - He
  15194 - started
  15195 - walking
  15196 - along
  15197 - the
  15198 - alley
  15199 - idly
  15200 - thwacking
  15201 - the
  15202 - hedges
  15203 - on
  15204 - either
  15205 - side
  15206 - with
  15207 - his
  15208 - fork
  15209 - But
  15210 - you
  15211 - don‘t
  15212 - see
  15213 - them
  15214 - around

  15216 - often

  15218 - They
  15219 - walked
  15220 - in
  15221 - silence
  15222 - for
  15223 - a
  15224 - while
  15225 - after
  15226 - that
  15227 - It
  15228 - was
  15229 - pleasantly
  15230 - cool
  15231 - between
  15232 - the
  15233 - hedges
  15234 - with
  15235 - the
  15236 - dappled
  15237 - green
  15238 - light
  15239 - and
  15240 - the
  15241 - beautiful
  15242 - blue
  15243 - sky

  15251 - into
  15252 - a
  15253 - sense
  15254 - of
  15255 - peacefulness

  15257 - he
  15258 - knew
  15259 - it
  15260 - was
  15261 - only
  15262 - an
  15263 - illusion

  15265 - was
  15266 - thinking
  15267 - hard
  15268 - about
  15269 - what
  15270 - he
  15271 - could
  15272 - and

  15280 - he
  15281 - asked

  15283 - they
  15284 - approached
  15285 - the
  15286 - first
  15287 - junction

  15335 - didn‘t
  15336 - look

  15340 - the
  15341 - boy
  15342 - replied
  15343 - but
  15344 - stared
  15345 - around

  15347 - looked
  15348 - up
  15349 - and
  15350 - along

  15352 - hedges

  15369 - ache

  15458 - something
  15459 - –
  15460 - a
  15461 - rustle
  15462 - in
  15463 - the
  15464 - hedge

  15471 - wriggling
  15472 - through
  15473 - the

  15477 - he
  15478 - couldn‘t
  15479 - see
  15480 - anything

  15482 - the
  15483 - sound
  15484 - stopped

  15486 - he
  15487 - slowly
  15488 - turned
  15489 - his
  15490 - head

  15502 - Arthur
  15503 - hesitated

  15538 - grabbed

  15570 - into

  16165 - might
  16166 - be
  16167 - lucky

  16169 - find
  16170 - that
  16171 - the
  16172 - floor
  16173 - they
  16174 - needed
  16175 - where
  16176 - the

  16209 - furled
  16210 - at
  16211 - their

  16227 - the
  16228 - few
  16229 - that
  16230 - glanced
  16231 - across
  16232 - did
  16233 - not

  16235 - the

  16237 - of
  16238 - what

  16278 - Course
  16279 - I

  16285 - the
  16286 - Will
  16287 - There
  16288 - was
  16289 - silence

  16291 - they
  16292 - descended
  16293 - several
  16294 - more
  16295 - floors

  16297 - the
  16298 - raven
  16299 - poked
  16300 - its
  16301 - head
  16302 - out
  16303 - of
  16304 - Giac‘s
  16305 - umbrella
  16306 - a
  16307 - little
  16308 - more
  16309 - so
  16310 - that
  16311 - one
  16312 - sharp
  16313 - eye
  16314 - stared
  16315 - up
  16316 - at
  16317 - Suzy
  16318 - As

  16334 - the
  16335 - Will
  16336 - asked
  16337 - I‘m
  16338 - thinking
  16339 - said
  16340 - Suzy
  16341 - She
  16342 - certainly
  16343 - looked
  16344 - thoughtful
  16345 - staring
  16346 - at
  16347 - each
  16348 - passing
  16349 - floor
  16350 - and
  16351 - hardly
  16352 - blinking
  16353 - Will

  16355 - seen
  16356 - you

  16369 - Within

  16373 - can
  16374 - change
  16375 - my
  16376 - outward

  16379 - Could

  16387 - asked
  16388 - Suzy

  16399 - Green

  16419 - patterns

  16430 - So
  16431 - you‘ll
  16432 - need
  16433 - to
  16434 - be
  16435 - a
  16436 - blue
  16437 - capsule
  16438 - Suzy

  16443 - come
  16444 - out

  16478 - you
  16479 - who‘ll
  16480 - be

  16516 - open
  16517 - an
  16518 - elevator—
  16519 - That‘s
  16520 - not
  16521 - much
  16522 - of
  16523 - a
  16524 - plan
  16525 - interrupted
  16526 - the

  16574 - the

  16577 - I
  16578 - really
  16579 - think
  16580 - this
  16581 - is
  16582 - a
  16583 - rotten

  16899 - by
  16900 - the
  16901 - closer
  16902 - desks
  16903 - the
  16904 - muttering
  16905 - behind
  16906 - them
  16907 - changed
  16908 - The
  16909 - whispers
  16910 - grew
  16911 - louder
  16912 - and
  16913 - sounded
  16914 - angry
  16915 - Not
  16916 - me…
  16917 - Where‘s
  16918 - the
  16919 - brat
  16920 - going
  16921 - ”
  16922 - It
  16923 - can‘t
  16924 - be
  16925 - them…
  16926 - Suzy
  16927 - sped
  16928 - up
  16929 - a
  16930 - little
  16931 - and
  16932 - drew
  16933 - the
  16934 - message
  16935 - capsule
  16936 - close
  16937 - so
  16938 - she
  16939 - could
  16940 - whisper
  16941 - I
  16942 - forgot
  16943 - to
  16944 - ask…Will
  16945 - any
  16946 - desk
  16947 - do
  16948 - ”
  16949 - Close
  16950 - to
  16951 - the
  16952 - elevators
  16953 - replied
  16954 - the
  16955 - Will
  16956 - very
  16957 - softly
  16958 - As
  16959 - soon
  16960 - as
  16961 - I‘m
  16962 - done
  16963 - we‘ll
  16964 - have
  16965 - to
  16966 - run
  16967 - ”
  16968 - Suzy
  16969 - changed
  16970 - direction
  16971 - the
  16972 - movement
  16973 - eliciting
  16974 - a
  16975 - gasp
  16976 - of
  16977 - expectation
  16978 - from
  16979 - the
  16980 - sorcerers
  16981 - ahead
  16982 - of
  16983 - her
  16984 - and
  16985 - a
  16986 - groan
  16987 - of
  16988 - disappointment
  16989 - from
  16990 - the
  16991 - ones
  16992 - behind
  16993 - They‘re
  16994 - getting
  16995 - ready
  16996 - to
  16997 - throw
  16998 - things
  16999 - at
  17000 - the
  17001 - chosen
  17002 - ones
  17003 - muttered
  17004 - Giac
  17005 - looming
  17006 - close
  17007 - behind
  17008 - Suzy‘s
  17009 - shoulder
  17010 - And
  17011 - at
  17012 - us
  17013 - of
  17014 - course
  17015 - ”
  17016 - Suzy
  17017 - didn‘t
  17018 - answer
  17019 - She‘d
  17020 - fixed
  17021 - her
  17022 - eye
  17023 - on
  17024 - a
  17025 - desk
  17026 - immediately
  17027 - in
  17028 - front
  17029 - of
  17030 - the
  17031 - closest
  17032 - elevator
  17033 - The
  17034 - sorcerer
  17035 - there
  17036 - was
  17037 - watching
  17038 - her
  17039 - like
  17040 - all
  17041 - the
  17042 - others
  17043 - but
  17044 - she
  17045 - thought
  17046 - he
  17047 - looked
  17048 - just
  17049 - a
  17050 - shade
  17051 - shorter
  17052 - than
  17053 - his
  17054 - neighbors
  17055 - which
  17056 - probably
  17057 - meant
  17058 - he
  17059 - had
  17060 - been
  17061 - recently
  17062 - promoted
  17063 - to
  17064 - the
  17065 - green
  17066 - levels
  17067 - Choosing
  17068 - him
  17069 - for
  17070 - another
  17071 - promotion
  17072 - would
  17073 - likely
  17074 - create
  17075 - the
  17076 - biggest
  17077 - possible
  17078 - uproar
  17079 - As
  17080 - she
  17081 - got
  17082 - closer
  17083 - the
  17084 - noise
  17085 - behind
  17086 - her
  17087 - increased
  17088 - and
  17089 - the
  17090 - tone
  17091 - of
  17092 - it
  17093 - sounded
  17094 - considerably
  17095 - uglier
  17096 - Suzy
  17097 - ignored
  17098 - it
  17099 - and
  17100 - stopped
  17101 - in
  17102 - front
  17103 - of
  17104 - the
  17105 - desk
  17106 - with
  17107 - the
  17108 - slightly
  17109 - shorter
  17110 - Denizen
  17111 - He
  17112 - looked
  17113 - up
  17114 - at
  17115 - her
  17116 - his
  17117 - eyebrows
  17118 - arched
  17119 - in
  17120 - surprise
  17121 - Yes
  17122 - ”
  17123 - You
  17124 - are
  17125 - Mmmph
  17126 - Bltthh
  17127 - ”
  17128 - asked
  17129 - Suzy
  17130 - turning
  17131 - her
  17132 - head
  17133 - so
  17134 - as
  17135 - to
  17136 - make
  17137 - her
  17138 - garbled
  17139 - words
  17140 - even
  17141 - harder
  17142 - to
  17143 - figure
  17144 - out
  17145 - As
  17146 - she
  17147 - spoke
  17148 - she
  17149 - put
  17150 - the
  17151 - message
  17152 - capsule
  17153 - on
  17154 - the
  17155 - desk
  17156 - I
  17157 - am
  17158 - Sorcerer
  17159 - Seventh
  17160 - Class
  17161 - Xagis
  17162 - said
  17163 - the
  17164 - Denizen
  17165 - Right
  17166 - said
  17167 - Suzy
  17168 - Then
  17169 - it‘s
  17170 - you
  17171 - and
  17172 - two
  17173 - more
  17174 - desks
  17175 - in
  17176 - that
  17177 - direction
  17178 - and
  17179 - three
  17180 - in
  17181 - that
  17182 - direction
  17183 - ”
  17184 - I‘m
  17185 - getting
  17186 - promoted
  17187 - ”
  17188 - asked
  17189 - Xagis
  17190 - in
  17191 - disbelief
  17192 - Again
  17193 - ”
  17194 - Yep
  17195 - said
  17196 - Suzy
  17197 - You
  17198 - are—Ow
  17199 - ”
  17200 - A
  17201 - flying
  17202 - inkwell
  17203 - bounced
  17204 - off
  17205 - her
  17206 - shoulder
  17207 - Suzy
  17208 - ducked
  17209 - a
  17210 - more
  17211 - deadly
  17212 - letter-opener
  17213 - and
  17214 - ran
  17215 - around
  17216 - to
  17217 - the
  17218 - far
  17219 - side
  17220 - of
  17221 - the
  17222 - desk
  17223 - Xagis
  17224 - was
  17225 - already
  17226 - crouching
  17227 - underneath
  17228 - it
  17229 - Giac
  17230 - on
  17231 - the
  17232 - other
  17233 - hand
  17234 - was
  17235 - capering
  17236 - up
  17237 - and
  17238 - down
  17239 - and
  17240 - pointing
  17241 - out
  17242 - towards
  17243 - the
  17244 - exterior
  17245 - of
  17246 - the
  17247 - building
  17248 - Invaders
  17249 - ”
  17250 - he
  17251 - shouted
  17252 - Newniths
  17253 - ”
  17254 - Suzy
  17255 - grinned
  17256 - at
  17257 - him
  17258 - and
  17259 - gave
  17260 - him
  17261 - the
  17262 - thumbs-up
  17263 - thinking
  17264 - he
  17265 - was
  17266 - making
  17267 - a
  17268 - diversion
  17269 - She
  17270 - glanced
  17271 - over
  17272 - the
  17273 - top
  17274 - of
  17275 - the
  17276 - desk
  17277 - was
  17278 - almost
  17279 - hit
  17280 - by
  17281 - a
  17282 - small
  17283 - tin
  17284 - of
  17285 - chalk
  17286 - that
  17287 - exploded
  17288 - open
  17289 - and
  17290 - powdered
  17291 - Xagis
  17292 - with
  17293 - chalk
  17294 - dust
  17295 - and
  17296 - saw
  17297 - that
  17298 - the
  17299 - Will
  17300 - had
  17301 - grown
  17302 - little
  17303 - legs
  17304 - and
  17305 - scurried
  17306 - into
  17307 - a
  17308 - drawer
  17309 - of
  17310 - the
  17311 - desk
  17312 - where
  17313 - it
  17314 - was
  17315 - working
  17316 - away
  17317 - at
  17318 - something
  17319 - Lots
  17320 - of

  17323 - shrieked

  17325 - Prepare
  17326 - to
  17327 - repel
  17328 - the
  17329 - enemy

  17331 - shouted
  17332 - someone
  17333 - else
  17334 - The
  17335 - missiles
  17336 - stopped
  17337 - hitting
  17338 - the
  17339 - desk
  17340 - Suzy
  17341 - took
  17342 - another
  17343 - look
  17344 - and
  17345 - saw
  17346 - the
  17347 - Denizens

  17349 - all
  17350 - getting
  17351 - out
  17352 - from
  17353 - behind
  17354 - their
  17355 - desks
  17356 - and
  17357 - grabbing
  17358 - their
  17359 - umbrellas
  17360 - Giac
  17361 - was
  17362 - still
  17363 - jumping
  17364 - up
  17365 - and
  17366 - down
  17367 - and
  17368 - pointing
  17369 - Suzy
  17370 - looked
  17371 - where
  17372 - he
  17373 - indicated
  17374 - and
  17375 - saw
  17376 - that
  17377 - his
  17378 - diversion
  17379 - was
  17380 - not
  17381 - just
  17382 - a
  17383 - thing
  17384 - of
  17385 - words
  17386 - and
  17387 - invention
  17388 - There
  17389 - were
  17390 - Newniths
  17391 - coming
  17392 - on
  17393 - to
  17394 - the
  17395 - floor
  17396 - –
  17397 - leather-winged
  17398 - Newniths
  17399 - flying
  17400 - in
  17401 - on
  17402 - the
  17403 - western
  17404 - side
  17405 - of

  17411 - plates
  17412 - of
  17413 - dull
  17414 - red
  17415 - armor
  17416 - on

  17419 - and
  17420 - legs
  17421 - breast-plates
  17422 - of
  17423 - the
  17424 - same
  17425 - metal
  17426 - and
  17427 - closed
  17428 - golden
  17429 - helmets
  17430 - that
  17431 - had
  17432 - narrow
  17433 - eye
  17434 - slits
  17435 - and
  17436 - crosshatched
  17437 - mouth
  17438 - holes

  17440 - electrically
  17441 - charged
  17442 - two-handed
  17443 - swords
  17444 - they
  17445 - were
  17446 - more
  17447 - warlike
  17448 - and
  17449 - threatening
  17450 - than
  17451 - any
  17452 - Newniths
  17453 - Suzy
  17454 - had
  17455 - seen
  17456 - before
  17457 - more
  17458 - than
  17459 - living
  17460 - up
  17461 - to
  17462 - her
  17463 - threatening
  17464 - description
  17465 - of
  17466 - them
  17467 - to
  17468 - Giac
  17469 - Xagis

  17471 - his
  17472 - umbrella
  17473 - and
  17474 - rushed
  17475 - to
  17476 - join
  17477 - the
  17478 - ranks
  17479 - of
  17480 - sorcerers
  17481 - that

  17483 - forming
  17484 - to
  17485 - oppose
  17486 - the
  17487 - Newniths
  17488 - There
  17489 - were
  17490 - at
  17491 - least
  17492 - fifty
  17493 - of
  17494 - the
  17495 - invaders
  17496 - already
  17497 - on
  17498 - the
  17499 - western
  17500 - edge
  17501 - of
  17502 - the
  17503 - tower
  17504 - and
  17505 - they
  17506 - had
  17507 - hacked
  17508 - off
  17509 - the
  17510 - heads
  17511 - of
  17512 - the
  17513 - closest
  17514 - sorcerers
  17515 - who
  17516 - had
  17517 - not
  17518 - been
  17519 - quick
  17520 - enough
  17521 - to
  17522 - get
  17523 - out
  17524 - from

  17526 - desks
  17527 - or
  17528 - grab
  17529 - their
  17530 - umbrellas
  17531 - But
  17532 - the
  17533 - Denizens
  17534 - were
  17535 - beginning
  17536 - to
  17537 - fight
  17538 - back
  17539 - bolts
  17540 - of
  17541 - fire
  17542 - from
  17543 - their

  17550 - Suzy
  17551 - saw
  17552 - winged
  17553 - Denizens
  17554 - appear
  17555 - behind
  17556 - the
  17557 - attackers
  17558 - too
  17559 - swooping
  17560 - down
  17561 - at
  17562 - the
  17563 - hovering
  17564 - Newniths
  17565 - that
  17566 - were
  17567 - waiting
  17568 - their
  17569 - turn
  17570 - to
  17571 - come
  17572 - in
  17573 - an
  17574 - aerial
  17575 - battle
  17576 - commencing
  17577 - Suzy
  17578 - looked
  17579 - across
  17580 - at
  17581 - the
  17582 - elevator
  17583 - bank
  17584 - There
  17585 - was
  17586 - still
  17587 - no

  17592 - elevator
  17593 - behind
  17594 - the
  17595 - grille
  17596 - door

  17600 - she
  17601 - whispered
  17602 - to
  17603 - the
  17604 - desk
  17605 - Part
  17606 - Six
  17607 - of

  17610 - had
  17611 - disappeared
  17612 - completely
  17613 - into
  17614 - the

  17616 - and
  17617 - she
  17618 - couldn‘t
  17619 - see

  17623 - no
  17624 - answer
  17625 - How
  17626 - long

  17628 - Suzy
  17629 - repeated

  18412 - Leaf
  18413 - grimaced
  18414 - at
  18415 - the
  18416 - thought
  18417 - of

  18825 - back

  18827 - looked
  18828 - out

  18838 - made
  18839 - everything
  18840 - look
  18841 - blurry
  18842 - and
  18843 - it
  18844 - was
  18845 - initially
  18846 - hard
  18847 - to
  18848 - work
  18849 - out
  18850 - exactly
  18851 - where
  18852 - they
  18853 - were
  18854 - but
  18855 - she
  18856 - soon
  18857 - recognized
  18858 - a
  18859 - building
  18860 - and
  18861 - got
  18862 - her
  18863 - bearings
  18864 - Only
  18865 - a
  18866 - few
  18867 - minutes
  18868 - later
  18869 - they
  18870 - pulled

  18888 - hospital
  18889 - of
  18890 - any
  18891 - kind
  18892 - It
  18893 - looked
  18894 - just
  18895 - like
  18896 - the
  18897 - other
  18898 - low-rise
  18899 - oldish
  18900 - office
  18901 - buildings

  18927 - burn
  18928 - marks
  18929 - across
  18930 - the
  18931 - facade
  18932 - There
  18933 - had
  18934 - been
  18935 - some
  18936 - trees
  18937 - out
  18938 - in

  18940 - as
  18941 - well

  18951 - a
  18952 - momentary
  18953 - doubt
  18954 - as
  18955 - she
  18956 - climbed
  18957 - out
  18958 - the
  18959 - back
  18960 - of
  18961 - the
  18962 - personnel

  18964 - What
  18965 - if
  18966 - all
  18967 - the
  18968 - sleepers
  18969 - were
  18970 - gone
  18971 - transported
  18972 - back
  18973 - to
  18974 - the
  18975 - House
  18976 - by
  18977 - yet
  18978 - another
  18979 - machination
  18980 - of
  18981 - a
  18982 - Trustee
  18983 - Then
  18984 - Major
  18985 - Penhaligon
  18986 - would
  18987 - think

  18989 - was
  18990 - a
  18991 - nutcase
  18992 - or
  18993 - a
  18994 - real
  18995 - troublemaker—
  18996 - She
  18997 - was
  18998 - thinking
  18999 - about
  19000 - that
  19001 - when
  19002 - Martine
  19003 - suddenly
  19004 - burst
  19005 - out

  19009 - doors
  19010 - Though

  19014 - a
  19015 - scarf
  19016 - over
  19017 - her
  19018 - head
  19019 - and
  19020 - a
  19021 - surgical
  19022 - mask
  19023 - it
  19024 - was
  19025 - easy
  19026 - to
  19027 - tell
  19028 - just
  19029 - from
  19030 - her
  19031 - staring
  19032 - eyes
  19033 - that
  19034 - she
  19035 - was
  19036 - absolutely
  19037 - terrified

  19040 - she
  19041 - screamed

  19043 - almost
  19044 - fell
  19045 - down
  19046 - the
  19047 - wheelchair
  19048 - ramp
  19049 - towards

  19068 - have
  19069 - the
  19070 - breath
  19071 - to
  19072 - get
  19073 - out
  19074 - what

  19076 - wanted
  19077 - to

  19079 - but
  19080 - Leaf
  19081 - at

  19100 - Martine
  19101 - just

  19347 - was
  19348 - horrifyingly

  19412 - The
  19413 - tentacle

  19415 - as
  19416 - she
  19417 - spoke
  19418 - questing
  19419 - around
  19420 - the
  19421 - corner

  19498 - perhaps
  19499 - a
  19500 - neck
  19501 - about
  19502 - three
  19503 - feet
  19504 - long
  19505 - which
  19506 - supported
  19507 - a
  19508 - sensory
  19509 - organ
  19510 - that
  19511 - resembled
  19512 - a

  19516 - pale
  19517 - yellow

  19534 - these
  19535 - anemone
  19536 - tendrils
  19537 - all
  19538 - turned
  19539 - towards
  19540 - him
  19541 - as
  19542 - if
  19543 - it
  19544 - could
  19545 - sense
  19546 - his
  19547 - movement
  19548 - He
  19549 - stopped
  19550 - but
  19551 - most
  19552 - of
  19553 - the
  19554 - tendrils
  19555 - continued
  19556 - to
  19557 - point
  19558 - stiffly
  19559 - at
  19560 - him
  19561 - with
  19562 - only
  19563 - a
  19564 - few
  19565 - still
  19566 - fluttering
  19567 - on
  19568 - the
  19569 - sides
  19570 - as
  19571 - if
  19572 - they
  19573 - were
  19574 - watching
  19575 - for
  19576 - other
  19577 - potential
  19578 - enemies
  19579 - Watch
  19580 - it
  19581 - but
  19582 - hold
  19583 - your
  19584 - fire

  19586 - Major
  19587 - Penhaligon
  19588 - He
  19589 - then
  19590 - muttered
  19591 - something
  19592 - into
  19593 - his
  19594 - radio
  19595 - which
  19596 - Leaf
  19597 - couldn‘t
  19598 - catch
  19599 - I
  19600 - don‘t
  19601 - reckon
  19602 - shooting
  19603 - that
  19604 - with
  19605 - anything
  19606 - less
  19607 - than
  19608 - a
  19609 - fifty
  19610 - cal
  19611 - would
  19612 - be
  19613 - worthwhile

  19615 - Chen
  19616 - but
  19617 - she
  19618 - kept
  19619 - her
  19620 - pistol
  19621 - trained
  19622 - on
  19623 - the
  19624 - creature
  19625 - It‘s
  19626 - got
  19627 - a
  19628 - collar
  19629 - said
  19630 - Leaf
  19631 - pointing
  19632 - to
  19633 - a
  19634 - thin
  19635 - band
  19636 - that
  19637 - was
  19638 - wound
  19639 - around
  19640 - the
  19641 - neck-limb
  19642 - There
  19643 - was
  19644 - a
  19645 - slim
  19646 - braided
  19647 - lead
  19648 - attached
  19649 - to
  19650 - the
  19651 - collar
  19652 - and
  19653 - the
  19654 - lead
  19655 - stretched
  19656 - back
  19657 - around
  19658 - the
  19659 - corner

  19661 - said
  19662 - weird
  19663 - and
  19664 - you
  19665 - were
  19666 - so
  19667 - right
  19668 - said
  19669 - Chen
  19670 - I
  19671 - wonder
  19672 - who‘s
  19673 - holding
  19674 - the
  19675 - lead
  19676 - said
  19677 - Leaf
  19678 - She
  19679 - was
  19680 - answered
  19681 - a
  19682 - moment
  19683 - later
  19684 - when
  19685 - a
  19686 - humanoid
  19687 - figure
  19688 - stepped
  19689 - out
  19690 - from
  19691 - behind
  19692 - the
  19693 - creature
  19694 - He
  19695 - was
  19696 - green-skinned
  19697 - seven
  19698 - feet
  19699 - tall
  19700 - and
  19701 - wore
  19702 - a
  19703 - tailed
  19704 - coat
  19705 - made
  19706 - of
  19707 - autumn
  19708 - leaves
  19709 - and
  19710 - breeches
  19711 - apparently
  19712 - of
  19713 - green
  19714 - turf
  19715 - Because
  19716 - he
  19717 - wasn‘t
  19718 - wearing
  19719 - any
  19720 - shoes
  19721 - Leaf
  19722 - had
  19723 - a
  19724 - clear
  19725 - view
  19726 - of
  19727 - his
  19728 - long
  19729 - yellow-brown
  19730 - toes
  19731 - which
  19732 - closely
  19733 - resembled
  19734 - the
  19735 - taproots
  19736 - of
  19737 - a
  19738 - willow
  19739 - In
  19740 - his
  19741 - right
  19742 - hand

  19748 - butt
  19749 - planted
  19750 - upon

  19754 - staff
  19755 - of
  19756 - the
  19757 - scythe
  19758 - was
  19759 - at
  19760 - least
  19761 - nine
  19762 - feet
  19763 - long
  19764 - and
  19765 - the
  19766 - curving
  19767 - blade
  19768 - stretched
  19769 - behind
  19770 - him
  19771 - from
  19772 - shoulder
  19773 - to
  19774 - shoulder
  19775 - It
  19776 - was
  19777 - made
  19778 - from
  19779 - some
  19780 - dark
  19781 - metal
  19782 - that
  19783 - did
  19784 - not
  19785 - reflect
  19786 - the
  19787 - light
  19788 - I
  19789 - have
  19790 - come

  19804 - one
  19805 - negligent
  19806 - hand
  19807 - Leaf
  19808 - noticed
  19809 - that
  19810 - his
  19811 - thumbnails
  19812 - were
  19813 - a
  19814 - darker
  19815 - green
  19816 - than
  19817 - his
  19818 - skin
  19819 - so
  19820 - dark
  19821 - they
  19822 - were

  20105 - whined
  20106 - and
  20107 - slowly
  20108 - began
  20109 - to
  20110 - rise
  20111 - even
  20112 - as

  20117 - tentacles
  20118 - slithered

  20155 - a
  20156 - sudden
  20157 - impact
  20158 - knocking
  20159 - Leaf
  20160 - to
  20161 - the

  20174 - of
  20175 - the
  20176 - ramp

  20180 - it
  20181 - with
  20182 - her
  20183 - combat
  20184 - knife
  20185 - but
  20186 - its
  20187 - flesh
  20188 - was
  20189 - like
  20190 - a
  20191 - rubbery
  20192 - sponge
  20193 - The
  20194 - knife
  20195 - simply

  20206 - the
  20207 - tentacles
  20208 - fastened
  20209 - themselves
  20210 - completely
  20211 - around

  20213 - ramp
  20214 - and
  20215 - ripped

  20219 - heavy
  20220 - armor

  20222 - torn
  20223 - in
  20224 - half
  20225 - as

  20230 - of
  20231 - licorice

  20235 - flying
  20236 - through

  20239 - to
  20240 - crash

  20289 - out

  20315 - That

  20319 - the
  20320 - Reaper

  20339 - grabbed

  20344 - scrambled
  20345 - towards

  20347 - rear
  20348 - of
  20349 - the
  20350 - carrier
  20351 - There
  20352 - must
  20353 - be

  20356 - can—
  20357 - There

  20361 - quietly
  20362 - She
  20363 - shook
  20364 - off
  20365 - Major
  20366 - Penhaligon‘s
  20367 - light
  20368 - grip
  20369 - and
  20370 - stepped
  20371 - out
  20372 - of
  20373 - the
  20374 - carrier
  20375 - She
  20376 - stopped
  20377 - to
  20378 - look
  20379 - back
  20380 - and
  20381 - added
  20382 - There‘s

  20401 - asked

  20409 - the
  20410 - surprise
  20411 - and

  20422 - Yes

  20427 - said
  20428 - the
  20429 - Denizen
  20430 - He
  20431 - reached
  20432 - out
  20433 - and
  20434 - gripped
  20435 - Leaf‘s
  20436 - shoulder
  20437 - She
  20438 - flinched
  20439 - under
  20440 - his
  20441 - touch
  20442 - and
  20443 - felt
  20444 - a
  20445 - wave
  20446 - of
  20447 - fear
  20448 - so
  20449 - intense
  20450 - that
  20451 - she

  20455 - she
  20456 - fought
  20457 - against

  20460 - remained
  20461 - upright
  20462 - She

  20626 - intense
  20627 - blue
  20628 - light
  20629 - He
  20630 - had

  20638 - Old
  20639 - One
  20640 - to
  20641 - his

  20643 - so
  20644 - he
  20645 - struggled
  20646 - even
  20647 - harder
  20648 - But
  20649 - the
  20650 - Denizens
  20651 - were
  20652 - too
  20653 - strong
  20654 - and
  20655 - they
  20656 - were
  20657 - aided
  20658 - by
  20659 - the
  20660 - unseen
  20661 - power
  20662 - that
  20663 - Arthur
  20664 - felt
  20665 - pressing
  20666 - down
  20667 - upon

  20741 - made
  20742 - a
  20743 - slight
  20744 - gesture
  20745 - with
  20746 - the
  20747 - Key

  20817 - It
  20818 - felt
  20819 - like
  20820 - a
  20821 - terribly
  20822 - cold
  20823 - current
  20824 - in

  20833 - They
  20834 - felt
  20835 - so
  20836 - strong

  20838 - doubted
  20839 - whether

  20902 - Whatever

  20907 - to

  20911 - though
  20912 - it
  20913 - might
  20914 - grow
  20915 - and
  20916 - change

  20927 - up

  20930 - followed
  20931 - the
  20932 - direction
  20933 - of
  20934 - his
  20935 - gaze
  20936 - There
  20937 - was
  20938 - something
  20939 - above
  20940 - them
  20941 - a
  20942 - black
  20943 - dot
  20944 - against
  20945 - that
  20946 - beautiful
  20947 - blue
  20948 - sky
  20949 - with
  20950 - its
  20951 - whispery
  20952 - clouds
  20953 - The
  20954 - dot
  20955 - grew
  20956 - larger
  20957 - and
  20958 - larger
  20959 - swooping
  20960 - down
  20961 - towards
  20962 - them
  20963 - from
  20964 - some
  20965 - great
  20966 - height
  20967 - and
  20968 - Arthur
  20969 - saw
  20970 - it
  20971 - was
  20972 - a
  20973 - huge
  20974 - dragonfly
  20975 - It
  20976 - descended
  20977 - very
  20978 - quickly
  20979 - to
  20980 - hover
  20981 - up
  20982 - above
  20983 - them
  20984 - its
  20985 - wings
  20986 - almost
  20987 - touching
  20988 - the
  20989 - tops
  20990 - of
  20991 - the
  20992 - hedges
  20993 - on
  20994 - either
  20995 - side
  20996 - It
  20997 - was
  20998 - a
  20999 - very
  21000 - big
  21001 - dragonfly
  21002 - Its
  21003 - body
  21004 - was
  21005 - about
  21006 - sixty
  21007 - feet
  21008 - long
  21009 - and
  21010 - each
  21011 - of
  21012 - its
  21013 - multipart
  21014 - buzzing
  21015 - wings
  21016 - was
  21017 - easily
  21018 - twice
  21019 - that
  21020 - length
  21021 - Arthur
  21022 - couldn‘t
  21023 - see
  21024 - clearly
  21025 - from
  21026 - below
  21027 - but
  21028 - there
  21029 - was
  21030 - something
  21031 - on
  21032 - its
  21033 - back
  21034 - a
  21035 - kind
  21036 - of
  21037 - cabin
  21038 - or
  21039 - deckhouse
  21040 - with
  21041 - stained-glass
  21042 - windows

  21044 - a
  21045 - roof
  21046 - of
  21047 - wooden
  21048 - shingles
  21049 - A
  21050 - Denizen
  21051 - wearing
  21052 - a
  21053 - one-piece
  21054 - coverall
  21055 - of
  21056 - soft
  21057 - tan
  21058 - leather
  21059 - and
  21060 - a
  21061 - kind
  21062 - of
  21063 - hunting
  21064 - hat
  21065 - with
  21066 - a
  21067 - feather
  21068 - threw
  21069 - a
  21070 - long
  21071 - rope
  21072 - ladder
  21073 - down
  21074 - from
  21075 - the
  21076 - tail
  21077 - of
  21078 - the
  21079 - dragonfly
  21080 - The
  21081 - ladder
  21082 - unrolled
  21083 - itself
  21084 - as
  21085 - it
  21086 - fell
  21087 - ending
  21088 - near
  21089 - Lord
  21090 - Sunday
  21091 - who
  21092 - quickly
  21093 - began
  21094 - to
  21095 - climb
  21096 - up
  21097 - it
  21098 - effortlessly
  21099 - taking
  21100 - three
  21101 - or
  21102 - four
  21103 - rungs
  21104 - at
  21105 - once
  21106 - While
  21107 - Lord
  21108 - Sunday
  21109 - was
  21110 - climbing
  21111 - up
  21112 - the
  21113 - Denizen
  21114 - on
  21115 - the
  21116 - dragonfly
  21117 - went
  21118 - further
  21119 - back
  21120 - along
  21121 - the
  21122 - creature‘s
  21123 - body
  21124 - and
  21125 - threw
  21126 - down
  21127 - a
  21128 - rope
  21129 - that
  21130 - ended
  21131 - in
  21132 - a
  21133 - large
  21134 - hook
  21135 - The
  21136 - Denizens
  21137 - holding
  21138 - Arthur
  21139 - looped
  21140 - his
  21141 - chain
  21142 - around
  21143 - the
  21144 - hook
  21145 - the
  21146 - Denizen
  21147 - above
  21148 - waved
  21149 - to
  21150 - some
  21151 - other
  21152 - unseen
  21153 - crew
  21154 - and
  21155 - the
  21156 - rope
  21157 - was
  21158 - hauled
  21159 - up
  21160 - leaving
  21161 - Arthur
  21162 - dangling
  21163 - some
  21164 - thirty
  21165 - feet
  21166 - below
  21167 - the
  21168 - dragonfly
  21169 - It
  21170 - was
  21171 - a
  21172 - very
  21173 - painful
  21174 - position
  21175 - with
  21176 - his
  21177 - arms
  21178 - twisted
  21179 - behind
  21180 - his
  21181 - back
  21182 - and
  21183 - the
  21184 - manacles
  21185 - on
  21186 - his
  21187 - wrists
  21188 - supporting
  21189 - his
  21190 - entire
  21191 - weight
  21192 - Arthur
  21193 - knew
  21194 - that
  21195 - prior
  21196 - to
  21197 - his
  21198 - transformation
  21199 - he
  21200 - would
  21201 - have
  21202 - been
  21203 - screaming
  21204 - in
  21205 - pain
  21206 - as
  21207 - his
  21208 - arms
  21209 - were
  21210 - dislocated
  21211 - at
  21212 - the
  21213 - shoulder
  21214 - Now
  21215 - though
  21216 - it
  21217 - hurt
  21218 - a
  21219 - lot
  21220 - he
  21221 - merely
  21222 - grimaced
  21223 - and
  21224 - contained
  21225 - his
  21226 - pain
  21227 - the
  21228 - anger
  21229 - inside
  21230 - him
  21231 - still
  21232 - stronger
  21233 - than
  21234 - any
  21235 - other
  21236 - feeling
  21237 - Part
  21238 - of
  21239 - that
  21240 - anger
  21241 - was
  21242 - addressed
  21243 - to
  21244 - himself
  21245 - How
  21246 - could
  21247 - I
  21248 - have
  21249 - been
  21250 - so
  21251 - stupid
  21252 - Arthur
  21253 - thought
  21254 - I
  21255 - should
  21256 - have
  21257 - got
  21258 - out
  21259 - of
  21260 - here
  21261 - somehow
  21262 - as
  21263 - soon
  21264 - as
  21265 - I
  21266 - knew
  21267 - it
  21268 - was
  21269 - the
  21270 - Incomparable
  21271 - Gardens
  21272 - I
  21273 - never
  21274 - should
  21275 - have
  21276 - been
  21277 - so
  21278 - careless
  21279 - with
  21280 - an
  21281 - unknown
  21282 - Piper‘s
  21283 - child…
  21284 - The
  21285 - two
  21286 - tall
  21287 - green-skinned
  21288 - Denizens
  21289 - shinned
  21290 - up
  21291 - the
  21292 - rope
  21293 - ladder
  21294 - and
  21295 - it
  21296 - was
  21297 - drawn
  21298 - up
  21299 - Arthur
  21300 - heard
  21301 - a
  21302 - whistle
  21303 - above
  21304 - him
  21305 - and
  21306 - the
  21307 - thrum
  21308 - of
  21309 - the
  21310 - dragonfly‘s
  21311 - wings
  21312 - increased
  21313 - in
  21314 - tempo
  21315 - and
  21316 - pitch
  21317 - Its
  21318 - legs
  21319 - which
  21320 - had
  21321 - been
  21322 - dangling
  21323 - just
  21324 - above
  21325 - Arthur
  21326 - retracted
  21327 - against
  21328 - the
  21329 - vast
  21330 - abdomen
  21331 - The
  21332 - dragonfly
  21333 - zoomed
  21334 - up
  21335 - and
  21336 - jinked
  21337 - sharply
  21338 - to
  21339 - the
  21340 - right
  21341 - in
  21342 - a
  21343 - move
  21344 - that
  21345 - sent
  21346 - Arthur
  21347 - swinging
  21348 - on
  21349 - his
  21350 - chain
  21351 - jerking
  21352 - his
  21353 - arms
  21354 - enough
  21355 - to
  21356 - make
  21357 - him
  21358 - let
  21359 - out
  21360 - a
  21361 - small
  21362 - gasp
  21363 - His
  21364 - arms
  21365 - might
  21366 - be
  21367 - dislocation-proof
  21368 - now
  21369 - but
  21370 - some
  21371 - part
  21372 - of
  21373 - his
  21374 - brain
  21375 - hadn‘t
  21376 - worked
  21377 - that
  21378 - out
  21379 - and
  21380 - was
  21381 - still
  21382 - sending
  21383 - intense
  21384 - pain
  21385 - –
  21386 - do
  21387 - something
  21388 - signals
  21389 - Arthur
  21390 - forced
  21391 - the
  21392 - pain
  21393 - back
  21394 - down
  21395 - Then
  21396 - with
  21397 - a
  21398 - Herculean
  21399 - effort
  21400 - he
  21401 - leaned
  21402 - forward
  21403 - till
  21404 - he
  21405 - was
  21406 - head
  21407 - down
  21408 - hooked
  21409 - his
  21410 - feet
  21411 - through
  21412 - his
  21413 - linked
  21414 - arms
  21415 - and
  21416 - swung
  21417 - through
  21418 - so
  21419 - that
  21420 - his
  21421 - manacled
  21422 - wrists
  21423 - were
  21424 - now
  21425 - in
  21426 - front
  21427 - and
  21428 - above
  21429 - him
  21430 - and
  21431 - he
  21432 - could
  21433 - hold
  21434 - on
  21435 - to
  21436 - the
  21437 - chains
  21438 - rather
  21439 - than
  21440 - having
  21441 - his
  21442 - whole
  21443 - weight
  21444 - supported
  21445 - by
  21446 - the
  21447 - manacles
  21448 - and
  21449 - his
  21450 - wrists
  21451 - He
  21452 - was
  21453 - still
  21454 - suspended
  21455 - by
  21456 - chains
  21457 - under
  21458 - a
  21459 - fast-moving
  21460 - giant
  21461 - dragonfly
  21462 - but
  21463 - at
  21464 - least
  21465 - his
  21466 - wrists
  21467 - and
  21468 - shoulders
  21469 - didn‘t
  21470 - hurt
  21471 - as
  21472 - much
  21473 - With
  21474 - the
  21475 - lessening
  21476 - of
  21477 - the
  21478 - pain
  21479 - Arthur
  21480 - found
  21481 - he
  21482 - could
  21483 - concentrate
  21484 - on
  21485 - other
  21486 - things
  21487 - like
  21488 - looking
  21489 - around
  21490 - The
  21491 - dragonfly
  21492 - had
  21493 - settled
  21494 - into
  21495 - level
  21496 - flight
  21497 - at
  21498 - about
  21499 - a
  21500 - thousand
  21501 - feet
  21502 - up
  21503 - Arthur
  21504 - guessed
  21505 - giving
  21506 - him
  21507 - a
  21508 - panoramic
  21509 - view
  21510 - of
  21511 - the
  21512 - Incomparable
  21513 - Gardens
  21514 - In
  21515 - other
  21516 - circumstances
  21517 - it
  21518 - would
  21519 - have
  21520 - been
  21521 - a
  21522 - wonderful
  21523 - vista
  21524 - Below
  21525 - him
  21526 - was
  21527 - a
  21528 - patchwork
  21529 - of
  21530 - hundreds
  21531 - or
  21532 - possibly
  21533 - thousands
  21534 - of
  21535 - different
  21536 - gardens
  21537 - all
  21538 - separated
  21539 - by
  21540 - corridors
  21541 - of
  21542 - tall
  21543 - green
  21544 - hedges
  21545 - like
  21546 - the
  21547 - one
  21548 - in
  21549 - which
  21550 - he
  21551 - had
  21552 - been
  21553 - ambushed
  21554 - There
  21555 - were
  21556 - gardens
  21557 - that
  21558 - were
  21559 - small
  21560 - and
  21561 - green
  21562 - and
  21563 - tidy
  21564 - gardens
  21565 - of
  21566 - russet
  21567 - and
  21568 - tan
  21569 - that
  21570 - sprawled
  21571 - across
  21572 - many
  21573 - acres
  21574 - there
  21575 - were
  21576 - deserts
  21577 - and
  21578 - low
  21579 - rolling
  21580 - hills
  21581 - and
  21582 - swamps
  21583 - and
  21584 - even
  21585 - several
  21586 - beaches
  21587 - that
  21588 - bordered
  21589 - portions
  21590 - of
  21591 - ocean
  21592 - no
  21593 - more
  21594 - than
  21595 - a
  21596 - hundred
  21597 - yards
  21598 - long
  21599 - and
  21600 - wide
  21601 - A
  21602 - small
  21603 - proportion
  21604 - of
  21605 - the
  21606 - gardens
  21607 - had
  21608 - buildings
  21609 - varying
  21610 - from
  21611 - garden
  21612 - sheds
  21613 - to
  21614 - minarets
  21615 - and
  21616 - modern
  21617 - buildings
  21618 - that
  21619 - would
  21620 - not
  21621 - have
  21622 - looked
  21623 - out
  21624 - of
  21625 - place
  21626 - in
  21627 - Arthur‘s
  21628 - home
  21629 - town
  21630 - Amid
  21631 - the
  21632 - patchwork
  21633 - of
  21634 - gardens
  21635 - there
  21636 - were
  21637 - several
  21638 - other
  21639 - locations
  21640 - that
  21641 - occupied
  21642 - much
  21643 - larger
  21644 - areas
  21645 - One
  21646 - some
  21647 - distance
  21648 - away
  21649 - on
  21650 - Arthur‘s
  21651 - right
  21652 - was
  21653 - a
  21654 - green
  21655 - area
  21656 - that
  21657 - was
  21658 - at
  21659 - least
  21660 - a
  21661 - mile
  21662 - wide
  21663 - and
  21664 - several
  21665 - miles
  21666 - long
  21667 - with
  21668 - a
  21669 - dry
  21670 - pond
  21671 - or
  21672 - muddy
  21673 - pit
  21674 - at
  21675 - its
  21676 - center
  21677 - A
  21678 - moment
  21679 - later
  21680 - Arthur
  21681 - recognized
  21682 - this
  21683 - as
  21684 - the
  21685 - point
  21686 - where
  21687 - Saturday‘s
  21688 - assault
  21689 - ram
  21690 - had
  21691 - broken
  21692 - through
  21693 - and
  21694 - as
  21695 - he
  21696 - peered
  21697 - more
  21698 - closely
  21699 - he
  21700 - saw
  21701 - that
  21702 - there
  21703 - were
  21704 - tiny
  21705 - figures
  21706 - moving
  21707 - around
  21708 - the
  21709 - hole
  21710 - and
  21711 - across
  21712 - the
  21713 - green
  21714 - lawn
  21715 - towards
  21716 - the
  21717 - ridge
  21718 - of
  21719 - wildflowers
  21720 - where
  21721 - many
  21722 - more
  21723 - little
  21724 - dots
  21725 - moved
  21726 - But
  21727 - he
  21728 - was
  21729 - several
  21730 - miles
  21731 - away
  21732 - with
  21733 - the
  21734 - dragonfly
  21735 - climbing
  21736 - higher
  21737 - so
  21738 - he
  21739 - couldn‘t
  21740 - tell
  21741 - if
  21742 - the
  21743 - tiny
  21744 - figures
  21745 - were
  21746 - Sunday‘s
  21747 - insect
  21748 - soldiers
  21749 - or
  21750 - Saturday‘s
  21751 - Denizens
  21752 - Not
  21753 - that
  21754 - it
  21755 - really
  21756 - matters
  21757 - thought
  21758 - Arthur
  21759 - He
  21760 - needed
  21761 - to
  21762 - concentrate
  21763 - on
  21764 - what
  21765 - he
  21766 - was
  21767 - going
  21768 - to
  21769 - do
  21770 - instead
  21771 - of
  21772 - wondering
  21773 - about
  21774 - what
  21775 - was
  21776 - happening
  21777 - in
  21778 - the
  21779 - battle
  21780 - between
  21781 - Saturday
  21782 - and
  21783 - Sunday
  21784 - –
  21785 - or
  21786 - for
  21787 - that
  21788 - matter
  21789 - the
  21790 - battle
  21791 - in
  21792 - the
  21793 - Upper
  21794 - House
  21795 - below
  21796 - them
  21797 - between
  21798 - the
  21799 - Piper
  21800 - and
  21801 - Saturday
  21802 - He
  21803 - looked
  21804 - up
  21805 - at
  21806 - the
  21807 - manacles
  21808 - on
  21809 - his
  21810 - wrists
  21811 - As
  21812 - far
  21813 - as
  21814 - he
  21815 - could
  21816 - see
  21817 - with
  21818 - the
  21819 - wind
  21820 - in
  21821 - his
  21822 - eyes
  21823 - and
  21824 - the
  21825 - constant
  21826 - swinging
  21827 - back
  21828 - and
  21829 - forth
  21830 - as
  21831 - the
  21832 - dragonfly
  21833 - changed
  21834 - course
  21835 - the
  21836 - manacles
  21837 - were
  21838 - all
  21839 - one
  21840 - piece
  21841 - of
  21842 - sorcerous
  21843 - steel
  21844 - They
  21845 - had
  21846 - no
  21847 - keyholes
  21848 - or
  21849 - bolts
  21850 - or
  21851 - any
  21852 - other
  21853 - obvious
  21854 - fasteners
  21855 - and
  21856 - the
  21857 - chain
  21858 - ran
  21859 - through
  21860 - protruding
  21861 - eyelets
  21862 - that
  21863 - were
  21864 - half
  21865 - an
  21866 - inch
  21867 - thick
  21868 - and
  21869 - seemed
  21870 - as
  21871 - much
  21872 - part
  21873 - of
  21874 - the
  21875 - manacle
  21876 - as
  21877 - the
  21878 - main
  21879 - band
  21880 - with
  21881 - no
  21882 - signs
  21883 - of
  21884 - welds
  21885 - or
  21886 - any
  21887 - weakness
  21888 - that
  21889 - might
  21890 - be
  21891 - exploited
  21892 - It
  21893 - was
  21894 - likely
  21895 - that
  21896 - they
  21897 - could
  21898 - only
  21899 - be
  21900 - unfastened
  21901 - by
  21902 - the
  21903 - Seventh
  21904 - Key
  21905 - or
  21906 - some
  21907 - similar
  21908 - power
  21909 - Perhaps
  21910 - Arthur
  21911 - with
  21912 - all
  21913 - the
  21914 - other
  21915 - six
  21916 - Keys
  21917 - might
  21918 - be
  21919 - able
  21920 - to
  21921 - command
  21922 - his
  21923 - release
  21924 - if
  21925 - he
  21926 - was
  21927 - not
  21928 - opposed
  21929 - by
  21930 - Lord
  21931 - Sunday
  21932 - But
  21933 - he
  21934 - didn‘t
  21935 - have
  21936 - even
  21937 - one
  21938 - Key
  21939 - now
  21940 - He
  21941 - brought
  21942 - his
  21943 - wrists
  21944 - together
  21945 - and
  21946 - tried
  21947 - to
  21948 - get
  21949 - the
  21950 - fingers
  21951 - of
  21952 - his
  21953 - right
  21954 - hand
  21955 - under
  21956 - the
  21957 - left
  21958 - manacle
  21959 - to
  21960 - see
  21961 - if
  21962 - he
  21963 - could
  21964 - bend
  21965 - or
  21966 - break
  21967 - it
  21968 - with
  21969 - his
  21970 - now
  21971 - otherworldly
  21972 - strength
  21973 - But
  21974 - the
  21975 - manacles
  21976 - were
  21977 - too
  21978 - tight
  21979 - and
  21980 - in
  21981 - his
  21982 - heart
  21983 - he
  21984 - knew
  21985 - there
  21986 - was
  21987 - no
  21988 - chance
  21989 - that
  21990 - they
  21991 - could
  21992 - be
  21993 - opened
  21994 - by
  21995 - any
  21996 - physical
  21997 - act
  21998 - Made
  21999 - with
  22000 - sorcery
  22001 - they
  22002 - could
  22003 - only
  22004 - be
  22005 - undone
  22006 - by
  22007 - sorcery
  22008 - Next
  22009 - Arthur
  22010 - tried
  22011 - to
  22012 - summon
  22013 - a
  22014 - telephone
  22015 - as
  22016 - he
  22017 - had
  22018 - done
  22019 - in
  22020 - other
  22021 - parts
  22022 - of
  22023 - the
  22024 - House
  22025 - But
  22026 - whether
  22027 - he
  22028 - asked
  22029 - for
  22030 - one
  22031 - aloud
  22032 - or
  22033 - simply
  22034 - tried
  22035 - to
  22036 - will
  22037 - a
  22038 - telephone
  22039 - into
  22040 - existence
  22041 - nothing
  22042 - happened
  22043 - After
  22044 - that
  22045 - he
  22046 - tried
  22047 - to
  22048 - call
  22049 - the
  22050 - First
  22051 - Second
  22052 - Third
  22053 - and
  22054 - Fourth
  22055 - Keys
  22056 - to
  22057 - him
  22058 - as
  22059 - he
  22060 - had
  22061 - done
  22062 - in
  22063 - the
  22064 - Middle
  22065 - House
  22066 - But
  22067 - that
  22068 - didn‘t
  22069 - work
  22070 - either
  22071 - no
  22072 - matter
  22073 - how
  22074 - he
  22075 - shouted
  22076 - and
  22077 - raged
  22078 - his
  22079 - voice
  22080 - hoarse
  22081 - from
  22082 - whatever
  22083 - Sunday
  22084 - had
  22085 - done
  22086 - to
  22087 - him
  22088 - made
  22089 - worse
  22090 - by
  22091 - the
  22092 - constant
  22093 - rush
  22094 - of
  22095 - wind
  22096 - Always
  22097 - he
  22098 - felt
  22099 - the
  22100 - unseen
  22101 - pressure
  22102 - of
  22103 - the
  22104 - Seventh
  22105 - Key
  22106 - working
  22107 - against
  22108 - him
  22109 - It
  22110 - was
  22111 - clear
  22112 - that
  22113 - he
  22114 - could
  22115 - not
  22116 - prevail
  22117 - against
  22118 - it
  22119 - Despite
  22120 - that
  22121 - after
  22122 - a
  22123 - bit
  22124 - of
  22125 - a
  22126 - rest
  22127 - or
  22128 - as
  22129 - much
  22130 - of
  22131 - a
  22132 - rest
  22133 - as
  22134 - it
  22135 - was
  22136 - possible
  22137 - to
  22138 - have
  22139 - while
  22140 - swinging
  22141 - on
  22142 - chains
  22143 - under
  22144 - a
  22145 - giant
  22146 - dragonfly
  22147 - moving
  22148 - at
  22149 - full
  22150 - speed
  22151 - Arthur
  22152 - tried
  22153 - again
  22154 - But
  22155 - all
  22156 - he
  22157 - managed
  22158 - to
  22159 - do
  22160 - was
  22161 - give
  22162 - himself
  22163 - a
  22164 - raging
  22165 - headache
  22166 - to
  22167 - add
  22168 - to
  22169 - the
  22170 - pain
  22171 - in
  22172 - his
  22173 - wrists
  22174 - and
  22175 - shoulders
  22176 - Eventually
  22177 - he
  22178 - just
  22179 - let
  22180 - himself
  22181 - swing
  22182 - by
  22183 - his
  22184 - chains
  22185 - and
  22186 - tried
  22187 - to
  22188 - think
  22189 - He
  22190 - was
  22191 - in
  22192 - a
  22193 - desperate
  22194 - situation
  22195 - Arthur
  22196 - knew
  22197 - that
  22198 - much
  22199 - While
  22200 - he
  22201 - now
  22202 - was
  22203 - very
  22204 - hard
  22205 - to
  22206 - kill
  22207 - Lord
  22208 - Sunday
  22209 - certainly
  22210 - had
  22211 - the
  22212 - power
  22213 - to
  22214 - slay
  22215 - him
  22216 - if
  22217 - he
  22218 - wanted
  22219 - to
  22220 - though
  22221 - if
  22222 - he
  22223 - did
  22224 - want
  22225 - to
  22226 - he
  22227 - presumably
  22228 - would
  22229 - have
  22230 - already
  22231 - done
  22232 - so
  22233 - Arthur
  22234 - thought
  22235 - about
  22236 - that
  22237 - a
  22238 - little
  22239 - more
  22240 - Sunday
  22241 - had
  22242 - been
  22243 - able
  22244 - to
  22245 - catch
  22246 - and
  22247 - hold
  22248 - the
  22249 - Fifth
  22250 - and
  22251 - Sixth
  22252 - Keys
  22253 - while
  22254 - Arthur
  22255 - was
  22256 - being
  22257 - bound
  22258 - but
  22259 - perhaps
  22260 - if
  22261 - he‘d
  22262 - tried
  22263 - to
  22264 - kill
  22265 - Arthur
  22266 - the
  22267 - Keys
  22268 - would
  22269 - have
  22270 - defended
  22271 - him
  22272 - more
  22273 - strongly
  22274 - Also
  22275 - if
  22276 - he
  22277 - did
  22278 - kill
  22279 - Arthur
  22280 - then
  22281 - Sunday
  22282 - could
  22283 - never
  22284 - take
  22285 - the
  22286 - other
  22287 - Keys
  22288 - They
  22289 - had
  22290 - to
  22291 - be
  22292 - handed
  22293 - over
  22294 - willingly
  22295 - It
  22296 - was
  22297 - possible
  22298 - that
  22299 - Lord
  22300 - Sunday
  22301 - might
  22302 - not
  22303 - even
  22304 - want
  22305 - the
  22306 - other
  22307 - Keys
  22308 - Arthur
  22309 - had
  22310 - no
  22311 - idea
  22312 - what
  22313 - Sunday
  22314 - really
  22315 - wanted
  22316 - After
  22317 - all
  22318 - it
  22319 - was
  22320 - Saturday
  22321 - who
  22322 - had
  22323 - set
  22324 - the
  22325 - fall
  22326 - of
  22327 - the
  22328 - House
  22329 - in
  22330 - motion
  22331 - and
  22332 - Saturday
  22333 - who
  22334 - had
  22335 - invaded
  22336 - the
  22337 - Incomparable
  22338 - Gardens
  22339 - because
  22340 - the
  22341 - Gardens
  22342 - were
  22343 - the
  22344 - only
  22345 - part
  22346 - of
  22347 - the
  22348 - House
  22349 - likely
  22350 - to
  22351 - survive
  22352 - the
  22353 - onrush
  22354 - of
  22355 - Nothing
  22356 - that
  22357 - had
  22358 - already
  22359 - taken
  22360 - the
  22361 - Far
  22362 - Reaches
  22363 - the
  22364 - Lower
  22365 - House
  22366 - and
  22367 - who
  22368 - knew
  22369 - what
  22370 - else
  22371 - by
  22372 - now
  22373 - All
  22374 - Arthur
  22375 - knew
  22376 - was
  22377 - that
  22378 - Lord
  22379 - Sunday
  22380 - was
  22381 - one
  22382 - of
  22383 - the
  22384 - original
  22385 - faithless
  22386 - Trustees
  22387 - who
  22388 - had
  22389 - not
  22390 - obeyed
  22391 - the
  22392 - Architect
  22393 - and
  22394 - had
  22395 - broken
  22396 - and
  22397 - hidden
  22398 - the
  22399 - seven
  22400 - Parts
  22401 - of
  22402 - the
  22403 - Will
  22404 - instead
  22405 - of
  22406 - following
  22407 - the
  22408 - Will‘s
  22409 - instructions
  22410 - As
  22411 - Arthur
  22412 - was
  22413 - effectively
  22414 - an
  22415 - agent
  22416 - of
  22417 - the
  22418 - Will
  22419 - and
  22420 - the
  22421 - supposed
  22422 - Rightful
  22423 - Heir
  22424 - of
  22425 - the
  22426 - Architect
  22427 - Lord
  22428 - Sunday
  22429 - was
  22430 - automatically
  22431 - his
  22432 - enemy
  22433 - But
  22434 - maybe
  22435 - we
  22436 - can
  22437 - work
  22438 - something
  22439 - out
  22440 - he
  22441 - thought
  22442 - We
  22443 - both
  22444 - have
  22445 - to
  22446 - stop
  22447 - the
  22448 - tide
  22449 - of
  22450 - Nothing
  22451 - to
  22452 - save
  22453 - the
  22454 - House
  22455 - and
  22456 - the
  22457 - rest
  22458 - of
  22459 - the
  22460 - Universe
  22461 - Maybe
  22462 - I
  22463 - could
  22464 - confirm
  22465 - that
  22466 - he
  22467 - would
  22468 - stay
  22469 - in
  22470 - charge
  22471 - of
  22472 - the
  22473 - Incomparable
  22474 - Gardens
  22475 - and
  22476 - he‘d
  22477 - be
  22478 - left
  22479 - alone
  22480 - that
  22481 - seems
  22482 - to
  22483 - be
  22484 - what
  22485 - he
  22486 - wants…
  22487 - Arthur
  22488 - sighed
  22489 - as
  22490 - his
  22491 - thoughts
  22492 - continued
  22493 - into
  22494 - less
  22495 - optimistic
  22496 - regions
  22497 - Who
  22498 - am
  22499 - I
  22500 - kidding
  22501 - Dame
  22502 - Primus
  22503 - would
  22504 - never
  22505 - agree
  22506 - Besides
  22507 - who
  22508 - knows
  22509 - what
  22510 - Sunday
  22511 - is
  22512 - really
  22513 - up
  22514 - to
  22515 - I
  22516 - have
  22517 - to
  22518 - escape
  22519 - But
  22520 - how
  22521 - He
  22522 - sighed
  22523 - again
  22524 - the
  22525 - sigh
  22526 - turning
  22527 - into
  22528 - a
  22529 - grimace
  22530 - of
  22531 - pain
  22532 - as
  22533 - the
  22534 - dragonfly
  22535 - changed
  22536 - direction
  22537 - again
  22538 - swinging
  22539 - Arthur
  22540 - out
  22541 - wide
  22542 - scraping
  22543 - the
  22544 - manacles
  22545 - across
  22546 - the
  22547 - raw
  22548 - wounds
  22549 - on
  22550 - his
  22551 - wrists
  22552 - no
  22553 - matter
  22554 - how
  22555 - tightly
  22556 - he
  22557 - held
  22558 - the
  22559 - chain
  22560 - above
  22561 - the
  22562 - manacles
  22563 - With
  22564 - the
  22565 - pain
  22566 - came
  22567 - an
  22568 - unexpected
  22569 - realisation
  22570 - Since
  22571 - he‘d
  22572 - taken
  22573 - the
  22574 - Fifth
  22575 - Key
  22576 - at
  22577 - least
  22578 - any
  22579 - pain
  22580 - he
  22581 - felt
  22582 - had
  22583 - come
  22584 - with
  22585 - a
  22586 - burning
  22587 - desire
  22588 - to
  22589 - retaliate
  22590 - to
  22591 - strike
  22592 - against
  22593 - whoever
  22594 - or
  22595 - whatever
  22596 - had
  22597 - caused
  22598 - him
  22599 - hurt
  22600 - But
  22601 - he
  22602 - was
  22603 - not
  22604 - angry
  22605 - now
  22606 - and
  22607 - he
  22608 - felt
  22609 - no
  22610 - great
  22611 - store
  22612 - of
  22613 - rage
  22614 - waiting
  22615 - to
  22616 - explode
  22617 - within
  22618 - him
  22619 - I
  22620 - am
  22621 - weaker
  22622 - without
  22623 - my
  22624 - Keys
  22625 - thought
  22626 - Arthur
  22627 - But
  22628 - I
  22629 - am
  22630 - also
  22631 - more
  22632 - myself
  22633 - They
  22634 - were
  22635 - heading
  22636 - towards
  22637 - a
  22638 - new
  22639 - landmark
  22640 - a
  22641 - tall
  22642 - green
  22643 - hill
  22644 - that
  22645 - was
  22646 - still
  22647 - several
  22648 - miles
  22649 - away
  22650 - It
  22651 - looked
  22652 - a
  22653 - lot
  22654 - like
  22655 - Doorstop
  22656 - Hill
  22657 - in
  22658 - the
  22659 - Lower
  22660 - House
  22661 - though
  22662 - it
  22663 - was
  22664 - significantly
  22665 - higher
  22666 - and
  22667 - the
  22668 - bottom
  22669 - slopes
  22670 - were
  22671 - terraced
  22672 - and
  22673 - dotted
  22674 - with
  22675 - trees
  22676 - There
  22677 - was
  22678 - also
  22679 - something
  22680 - on
  22681 - the
  22682 - crest
  22683 - of
  22684 - the
  22685 - hill
  22686 - a
  22687 - low
  22688 - building
  22689 - or
  22690 - construction
  22691 - of
  22692 - some
  22693 - kind
  22694 - but
  22695 - it
  22696 - was
  22697 - too
  22698 - far
  22699 - for
  22700 - him
  22701 - to
  22702 - easily
  22703 - identify
  22704 - Directly
  22705 - below
  22706 - him
  22707 - the
  22708 - variety
  22709 - of
  22710 - gardens
  22711 - continued
  22712 - still
  22713 - divided
  22714 - and
  22715 - penned
  22716 - in
  22717 - by
  22718 - the
  22719 - tall
  22720 - green
  22721 - hedges
  22722 - Arthur
  22723 - watched
  22724 - them
  22725 - flicker
  22726 - by
  22727 - as
  22728 - he
  22729 - desperately
  22730 - tried
  22731 - to
  22732 - think
  22733 - of
  22734 - some
  22735 - stratagem
  22736 - to
  22737 - gain
  22738 - his
  22739 - release
  22740 - He
  22741 - let
  22742 - his
  22743 - eyes
  22744 - go
  22745 - out
  22746 - of
  22747 - focus
  22748 - half-lidding
  22749 - them
  22750 - against
  22751 - the
  22752 - rushing
  22753 - wind
  22754 - and
  22755 - the
  22756 - gardens
  22757 - below
  22758 - blurred
  22759 - into
  22760 - a
  22761 - patchwork
  22762 - of
  22763 - many
  22764 - shades
  22765 - of
  22766 - green
  22767 - and
  22768 - brown
  22769 - and
  22770 - blue
  22771 - Blue
  22772 - thought
  22773 - Arthur
  22774 - He
  22775 - blinked
  22776 - and
  22777 - refocused
  22778 - There
  22779 - was
  22780 - a
  22781 - lake
  22782 - and
  22783 - about
  22784 - half
  22785 - a
  22786 - mile
  22787 - beyond
  22788 - one
  22789 - of
  22790 - those
  22791 - strange
  22792 - truncated
  22793 - oceans
  22794 - dumping
  22795 - its
  22796 - waves
  22797 - on
  22798 - to
  22799 - a
  22800 - two-hundred-yard-long
  22801 - stretch
  22802 - of
  22803 - cut-off
  22804 - beach
  22805 - Navigable
  22806 - waters
  22807 - thought
  22808 - Arthur
  22809 - swiftly
  22810 - followed
  22811 - by
  22812 - a
  22813 - single
  22814 - piercing
  22815 - image
  22816 - of
  22817 - a
  22818 - tall
  22819 - white-
  22820 - bearded
  22821 - sailor
  22822 - with
  22823 - deep-set
  22824 - eyes
  22825 - of
  22826 - the
  22827 - clearest
  22828 - blue
  22829 - wielding
  22830 - a
  22831 - harpoon
  22832 - that
  22833 - glittered
  22834 - and
  22835 - shone
  22836 - with
  22837 - the
  22838 - most
  22839 - powerful
  22840 - sorcery
  22841 - This
  22842 - was
  22843 - the
  22844 - Mariner
  22845 - second
  22846 - son
  22847 - of
  22848 - the
  22849 - Architect
  22850 - and
  22851 - the
  22852 - Old
  22853 - One
  22854 - who
  22855 - had
  22856 - sworn
  22857 - to
  22858 - aid
  22859 - Arthur
  22860 - three
  22861 - times
  22862 - and
  22863 - had
  22864 - already
  22865 - done
  22866 - so
  22867 - twice
  22868 - Wherever
  22869 - there
  22870 - were
  22871 - navigable
  22872 - waters
  22873 - the
  22874 - Mariner
  22875 - could
  22876 - sail
  22877 - and
  22878 - Arthur
  22879 - thought
  22880 - that
  22881 - if
  22882 - anything
  22883 - other
  22884 - than
  22885 - the
  22886 - Seventh
  22887 - Key
  22888 - could
  22889 - break
  22890 - his
  22891 - chains
  22892 - it
  22893 - would
  22894 - be
  22895 - the
  22896 - Mariner‘s
  22897 - harpoon
  22898 - I
  22899 - have
  22900 - to
  22901 - call
  22902 - him
  22903 - straightaway
  22904 - since
  22905 - he
  22906 - could
  22907 - take
  22908 - ages
  22909 - to
  22910 - get
  22911 - here
  22912 - Which
  22913 - means
  22914 - I
  22915 - need
  22916 - my
  22917 - medal
  22918 - The
  22919 - Mariner‘s
  22920 - medal
  22921 - was
  22922 - in
  22923 - Arthur‘s
  22924 - belt
  22925 - pouch
  22926 - near
  22927 - his
  22928 - hip
  22929 - which
  22930 - presented
  22931 - a
  22932 - problem
  22933 - Suspended
  22934 - as
  22935 - he
  22936 - was
  22937 - with
  22938 - his
  22939 - wrists
  22940 - manacled
  22941 - together
  22942 - he
  22943 - couldn‘t
  22944 - just
  22945 - reach
  22946 - down
  22947 - undo
  22948 - the
  22949 - pouch
  22950 - and
  22951 - retrieve
  22952 - it
  22953 - Nor
  22954 - after
  22955 - a
  22956 - few
  22957 - attempts
  22958 - could
  22959 - he
  22960 - pull
  22961 - himself
  22962 - up
  22963 - high
  22964 - enough
  22965 - to
  22966 - get
  22967 - his
  22968 - hands
  22969 - near
  22970 - the
  22971 - pouch
  22972 - because
  22973 - when
  22974 - he
  22975 - did
  22976 - so
  22977 - he
  22978 - started
  22979 - to
  22980 - spin
  22981 - around
  22982 - violently
  22983 - Next
  22984 - Arthur
  22985 - tried
  22986 - swinging
  22987 - his
  22988 - legs
  22989 - up
  22990 - so
  22991 - that
  22992 - he
  22993 - could
  22994 - hang
  22995 - upside
  22996 - down
  22997 - But
  22998 - a
  22999 - few
  23000 - attempts
  23001 - showed
  23002 - him
  23003 - that
  23004 - even
  23005 - though
  23006 - he
  23007 - could
  23008 - manage
  23009 - to
  23010 - turn
  23011 - upside
  23012 - down
  23013 - and
  23014 - get
  23015 - his
  23016 - hands
  23017 - near
  23018 - his
  23019 - belt
  23020 - pouch
  23021 - without
  23022 - going
  23023 - into
  23024 - the
  23025 - same
  23026 - sort
  23027 - of
  23028 - spin
  23029 - there
  23030 - was
  23031 - no
  23032 - way
  23033 - he
  23034 - could
  23035 - undo
  23036 - the
  23037 - pouch
  23038 - and
  23039 - get
  23040 - the
  23041 - medallion
  23042 - out
  23043 - at
  23044 - least
  23045 - not
  23046 - without
  23047 - a
  23048 - very
  23049 - high
  23050 - chance
  23051 - of
  23052 - the
  23053 - medallion
  23054 - and
  23055 - his
  23056 - yellow
  23057 - elephant
  23058 - simply
  23059 - dropping
  23060 - out
  23061 - and
  23062 - being
  23063 - lost
  23064 - forever
  23065 - He
  23066 - was
  23067 - still
  23068 - trying
  23069 - to
  23070 - work
  23071 - out
  23072 - how
  23073 - he
  23074 - could
  23075 - get
  23076 - the
  23077 - medal
  23078 - when
  23079 - the
  23080 - dragonfly
  23081 - began
  23082 - to
  23083 - descend
  23084 - It
  23085 - was
  23086 - still
  23087 - flying
  23088 - towards
  23089 - the
  23090 - terraced
  23091 - hill
  23092 - Arthur
  23093 - had
  23094 - seen
  23095 - only
  23096 - it
  23097 - was
  23098 - no
  23099 - longer
  23100 - aiming
  23101 - for
  23102 - the
  23103 - top
  23104 - of
  23105 - the
  23106 - hill
  23107 - but
  23108 - at
  23109 - a
  23110 - point
  23111 - about
  23112 - halfway
  23113 - up
  23114 - Arthur
  23115 - swung
  23116 - himself
  23117 - right
  23118 - way
  23119 - up
  23120 - again
  23121 - as
  23122 - he
  23123 - got
  23124 - lower
  23125 - and
  23126 - tried
  23127 - to
  23128 - stop
  23129 - his
  23130 - spin
  23131 - There
  23132 - was
  23133 - something
  23134 - on
  23135 - the
  23136 - terrace
  23137 - that
  23138 - had
  23139 - caught
  23140 - his
  23141 - eye
  23142 - and
  23143 - he
  23144 - wanted
  23145 - a
  23146 - better
  23147 - look
  23148 - He
  23149 - got
  23150 - it
  23151 - and
  23152 - he
  23153 - felt
  23154 - a
  23155 - chill
  23156 - colder
  23157 - than
  23158 - the
  23159 - icy
  23160 - steel
  23161 - On
  23162 - the
  23163 - terrace
  23164 - halfway
  23165 - up
  23166 - the
  23167 - hill
  23168 - lying
  23169 - flat
  23170 - was
  23171 - a
  23172 - twenty-foot-wide
  23173 - clock
  23174 - face
  23175 - with
  23176 - vertical
  23177 - numbers
  23178 - of
  23179 - blue
  23180 - sorcerous
  23181 - metal
  23182 - The
  23183 - clock
  23184 - had
  23185 - long
  23186 - sharply
  23187 - pointed
  23188 - hands
  23189 - and
  23190 - next
  23191 - to
  23192 - their
  23193 - central
  23194 - pivot
  23195 - was
  23196 - a
  23197 - small
  23198 - trapdoor
  23199 - It
  23200 - was
  23201 - a
  23202 - smaller
  23203 - replica
  23204 - of
  23205 - the
  23206 - Old
  23207 - One‘s
  23208 - prison
  23209 - save
  23210 - that
  23211 - there
  23212 - was
  23213 - no
  23214 - one
  23215 - chained
  23216 - to
  23217 - the
  23218 - clock
  23219 - hands
  23220 - Or
  23221 - at
  23222 - least
  23223 - Arthur
  23224 - thought
  23225 - there
  23226 - was
  23227 - no
  23228 - one
  23229 - chained
  23230 - there
  23231 - yet…
  23232 - CHAPTER
  23233 - NINE
  23234 - The
  23235 - elevator
  23236 - fell
  23237 - faster
  23238 - than
  23239 - was
  23240 - usual
  23241 - and
  23242 - the
  23243 - ride
  23244 - was
  23245 - far
  23246 - less
  23247 - smooth
  23248 - Suzy
  23249 - and
  23250 - Giac
  23251 - were
  23252 - thrown
  23253 - against
  23254 - the
  23255 - walls
  23256 - and
  23257 - Part
  23258 - Six
  23259 - of
  23260 - the
  23261 - Will
  23262 - had
  23263 - to
  23264 - constantly
  23265 - flap
  23266 - its
  23267 - wings
  23268 - to
  23269 - keep
  23270 - its
  23271 - balance
  23272 - finally
  23273 - just
  23274 - latching
  23275 - on
  23276 - to
  23277 - Suzy‘s
  23278 - shoulder
  23279 - It
  23280 - continued
  23281 - to
  23282 - flap
  23283 - there
  23284 - too
  23285 - as
  23286 - Suzy
  23287 - tried
  23288 - to
  23289 - wedge
  23290 - herself
  23291 - into
  23292 - one
  23293 - corner
  23294 - to
  23295 - keep
  23296 - steady
  23297 - with
  23298 - Giac
  23299 - in
  23300 - the
  23301 - opposite
  23302 - corner
  23303 - Even
  23304 - more
  23305 - alarming
  23306 - every
  23307 - now
  23308 - and
  23309 - then
  23310 - a
  23311 - tiny
  23312 - globule
  23313 - of
  23314 - Nothing
  23315 - would
  23316 - explode
  23317 - through
  23318 - the
  23319 - floor
  23320 - and
  23321 - exit
  23322 - through
  23323 - the
  23324 - ceiling
  23325 - This
  23326 - mostly
  23327 - happened
  23328 - near
  23329 - the
  23330 - back
  23331 - of
  23332 - the
  23333 - elevator
  23334 - and
  23335 - the
  23336 - three
  23337 - passengers
  23338 - kept
  23339 - well
  23340 - away
  23341 - If
  23342 - the
  23343 - Nothing
  23344 - actually
  23345 - hit
  23346 - anyone
  23347 - it
  23348 - would
  23349 - dissolve
  23350 - everything
  23351 - in
  23352 - its
  23353 - upward
  23354 - path
  23355 - Even
  23356 - a
  23357 - glancing
  23358 - pass
  23359 - might
  23360 - destroy
  23361 - a
  23362 - hand
  23363 - or
  23364 - foot
  23365 - It
  23366 - was
  23367 - also
  23368 - a
  23369 - frightening
  23370 - indication
  23371 - that
  23372 - Nothing
  23373 - was
  23374 - continuing
  23375 - to
  23376 - impinge
  23377 - on
  23378 - the
  23379 - House
  23380 - If
  23381 - there
  23382 - were
  23383 - globules
  23384 - and
  23385 - particles
  23386 - of
  23387 - Nothing
  23388 - loose
  23389 - in
  23390 - the
  23391 - elevator
  23392 - shafts
  23393 - it
  23394 - was
  23395 - likely
  23396 - the
  23397 - Void
  23398 - had
  23399 - breached
  23400 - more
  23401 - defenses
  23402 - Are
  23403 - you
  23404 - sure
  23405 - you
  23406 - pressed
  23407 - the
  23408 - right
  23409 - button
  23410 - ”
  23411 - asked
  23412 - Suzy
  23413 - Cos
  23414 - you
  23415 - know
  23416 - half
  23417 - the
  23418 - House
  23419 - is
  23420 - just
  23421 - Nothing
  23422 - now
  23423 - and
  23424 - if
  23425 - we‘re
  23426 - dropping
  23427 - into
  23428 - it—
  23429 - The
  23430 - corroded
  23431 - buttons
  23432 - indicate
  23433 - high
  23434 - contamination
  23435 - by
  23436 - Nothing
  23437 - said
  23438 - the
  23439 - Will
  23440 - who
  23441 - had
  23442 - been
  23443 - studying
  23444 - the
  23445 - rows
  23446 - of
  23447 - bronze
  23448 - or
  23449 - formerly
  23450 - bronze
  23451 - buttons
  23452 - Those
  23453 - that
  23454 - are
  23455 - entirely
  23456 - black
  23457 - and
  23458 - crumbled
  23459 - show
  23460 - lost
  23461 - portions
  23462 - of
  23463 - the
  23464 - House
  23465 - ”
  23466 - So
  23467 - the
  23468 - one
  23469 - for
  23470 - the
  23471 - Great
  23472 - Maze
  23473 - was
  23474 - still
  23475 - bright
  23476 - ”
  23477 - asked
  23478 - Suzy
  23479 - That‘s
  23480 - good
  23481 - ”
  23482 - Not
  23483 - entirely
  23484 - said
  23485 - the
  23486 - Will
  23487 - There
  23488 - are
  23489 - several
  23490 - elevator
  23491 - positions
  23492 - within
  23493 - the
  23494 - Maze
  23495 - Some
  23496 - of
  23497 - them
  23498 - are
  23499 - black
  23500 - The
  23501 - one
  23502 - I
  23503 - chose
  23504 - is
  23505 - a
  23506 - little
  23507 - tarnished
  23508 - and
  23509 - the
  23510 - verdigris
  23511 - is
  23512 - spreading
  23513 - even
  23514 - in
  23515 - this
  23516 - short
  23517 - time
  23518 - ”
  23519 - The
  23520 - Maze
  23521 - is
  23522 - dissolving
  23523 - ”
  23524 - asked
  23525 - Suzy
  23526 - Nothing
  23527 - is
  23528 - spreading
  23529 - there
  23530 - as
  23531 - well
  23532 - ”
  23533 - It
  23534 - appears
  23535 - so
  23536 - said
  23537 - the
  23538 - Will
  23539 - I
  23540 - think
  23541 - we
  23542 - had
  23543 - better
  23544 - hurry
  23545 - this
  23546 - elevator
  23547 - up
  23548 - ”
  23549 - It
  23550 - flew
  23551 - from
  23552 - Suzy‘s
  23553 - shoulder
  23554 - up
  23555 - to
  23556 - the
  23557 - ceiling
  23558 - above
  23559 - the
  23560 - buttons
  23561 - and
  23562 - using
  23563 - its
  23564 - beak
  23565 - like
  23566 - an
  23567 - ice
  23568 - pick
  23569 - smashed
  23570 - through
  23571 - a
  23572 - small
  23573 - walnut-and-ivory
  23574 - veneered
  23575 - panel
  23576 - that
  23577 - was
  23578 - set
  23579 - into
  23580 - the
  23581 - plainer
  23582 - wood
  23583 - There
  23584 - was
  23585 - a
  23586 - gold
  23587 - ring
  23588 - behind
  23589 - the
  23590 - panel
  23591 - The
  23592 - Will
  23593 - glanced
  23594 - back
  23595 - down
  23596 - and
  23597 - said
  23598 - Crouch
  23599 - and
  23600 - brace
  23601 - yourselves
  23602 - ”
  23603 - Suzy
  23604 - and
  23605 - Giac
  23606 - obeyed
  23607 - The
  23608 - raven
  23609 - grabbed
  23610 - the
  23611 - ring
  23612 - folded
  23613 - its
  23614 - wings
  23615 - and
  23616 - dropped
  23617 - back
  23618 - down
  23619 - to
  23620 - Suzy‘s
  23621 - shoulder
  23622 - pulling
  23623 - a
  23624 - slender
  23625 - golden
  23626 - chain
  23627 - out
  23628 - of
  23629 - the
  23630 - ceiling
  23631 - by
  23632 - the
  23633 - ring
  23634 - As
  23635 - the
  23636 - chain
  23637 - grew
  23638 - longer
  23639 - the
  23640 - elevator‘s
  23641 - speed
  23642 - increased
  23643 - By
  23644 - the
  23645 - time
  23646 - the
  23647 - Will
  23648 - arrived
  23649 - on
  23650 - Suzy‘s
  23651 - shoulder
  23652 - she
  23653 - felt
  23654 - herself
  23655 - rising
  23656 - into
  23657 - the
  23658 - air
  23659 - suddenly
  23660 - weightless
  23661 - as
  23662 - the
  23663 - elevator
  23664 - accelerated
  23665 - down
  23666 - I‘m
  23667 - floating
  23668 - ”
  23669 - she
  23670 - cried
  23671 - This
  23672 - is
  23673 - great
  23674 - ”
  23675 - Is
  23676 - it
  23677 - ”
  23678 - asked
  23679 - Giac
  23680 - worriedly
  23681 - Are
  23682 - you
  23683 - sure
  23684 - ”
  23685 - Hold
  23686 - on
  23687 - ”
  23688 - warned
  23689 - the
  23690 - Will
  23691 - We‘ll
  23692 - slow
  23693 - down
  23694 - just
  23695 - as
  23696 - fast
  23697 - Or
  23698 - hit
  23699 - very
  23700 - hard
  23701 - One
  23702 - two
  23703 - three
  23704 - four
  23705 - five
  23706 - six—
  23707 - The
  23708 - raven
  23709 - released
  23710 - the
  23711 - ring
  23712 - on
  23713 - six
  23714 - and
  23715 - the
  23716 - chain
  23717 - shot
  23718 - back
  23719 - into
  23720 - the
  23721 - ceiling
  23722 - As
  23723 - it
  23724 - did
  23725 - so
  23726 - the
  23727 - elevator
  23728 - slowed
  23729 - suddenly
  23730 - slamming
  23731 - Suzy
  23732 - and
  23733 - Giac
  23734 - to
  23735 - the
  23736 - floor
  23737 - A
  23738 - few
  23739 - seconds
  23740 - later
  23741 - there
  23742 - was
  23743 - a
  23744 - terrible
  23745 - impact
  23746 - The
  23747 - elevator
  23748 - exploded
  23749 - around
  23750 - them
  23751 - throwing
  23752 - them
  23753 - into
  23754 - the
  23755 - air
  23756 - again
  23757 - in
  23758 - a
  23759 - storm
  23760 - of
  23761 - splinters
  23762 - and
  23763 - broken
  23764 - floorboards
  23765 - Before
  23766 - they
  23767 - could
  23768 - fall
  23769 - back
  23770 - down
  23771 - everything
  23772 - tilted
  23773 - over
  23774 - on
  23775 - a
  23776 - sharp
  23777 - incline
  23778 - and
  23779 - all
  23780 - three
  23781 - of
  23782 - them
  23783 - slid
  23784 - down
  23785 - the
  23786 - wall
  23787 - and
  23788 - ended
  23789 - up
  23790 - in
  23791 - a
  23792 - confused
  23793 - tangle
  23794 - in
  23795 - the
  23796 - dangerous
  23797 - corner
  23798 - where
  23799 - the
  23800 - Nothing
  23801 - globules
  23802 - had
  23803 - turned
  23804 - the
  23805 - elevator
  23806 - into
  23807 - a
  23808 - sieve
  23809 - Finally
  23810 - a
  23811 - bell
  23812 - went
  23813 - ping
  23814 - and
  23815 - the
  23816 - inner
  23817 - door
  23818 - slid
  23819 - open
  23820 - to
  23821 - reveal
  23822 - a
  23823 - bent
  23824 - and

  23826 - grille

  23828 - that
  23829 - was
  23830 - hanging
  23831 - off
  23832 - its
  23833 - hinges
  23834 - Beyond
  23835 - it
  23836 - lay
  23837 - a
  23838 - guardroom
  23839 - where
  23840 - a
  23841 - dozen
  23842 - somewhat
  23843 - surprised
  23844 - Denizens
  23845 - uniformed
  23846 - in
  23847 - the
  23848 - buff
  23849 - coats
  23850 - and
  23851 - grey
  23852 - trousers

  23854 - the
  23855 - Moderately
  23856 - Honorable

  23858 - Company
  23859 - were
  23860 - snatching
  23861 - up
  23862 - and
  23863 - readying
  23864 - their
  23865 - musketoons
  23866 - pistols
  23867 - sparkizan
  23868 - halberds
  23869 - and
  23870 - swords
  23871 - Guess
  23872 - we‘re
  23873 - here
  23874 - said
  23875 - Suzy
  23876 - as
  23877 - she
  23878 - crawled
  23879 - across
  23880 - Giac‘s
  23881 - legs
  23882 - and
  23883 - brushed
  23884 - the
  23885 - Will‘s
  23886 - wings
  23887 - away
  23888 - from
  23889 - her
  23890 - face
  23891 - since
  23892 - it
  23893 - was
  23894 - perched
  23895 - on
  23896 - her
  23897 - head
  23898 - Wherever
  23899 - here
  23900 - is

  23902 - She
  23903 - stood
  23904 - up
  23905 - brushed
  23906 - off
  23907 - the
  23908 - splinters
  23909 - and
  23910 - dust
  23911 - and
  23912 - held
  23913 - up
  23914 - her
  23915 - hands
  23916 - which
  23917 - seemed
  23918 - a
  23919 - wise
  23920 - precaution
  23921 - given
  23922 - the
  23923 - number
  23924 - of
  23925 - Nothing-powder
  23926 - weapons
  23927 - that
  23928 - were
  23929 - now
  23930 - aimed
  23931 - at
  23932 - her
  23933 - including
  23934 - a
  23935 - small
  23936 - wheeled
  23937 - artillery
  23938 - piece
  23939 - that
  23940 - was
  23941 - being
  23942 - pushed
  23943 - over
  23944 - by
  23945 - another

  23950 - bronze
  23951 - barrel
  23952 - coming
  23953 - into
  23954 - alignment
  23955 - with

  23979 - The
  23980 - weapons
  23981 - were
  23982 - not

  23985 - no

  23987 - answered
  23988 - Suzy
  23989 - had
  23990 - a
  23991 - moment
  23992 - of
  23993 - doubt
  23994 - which
  23995 - was
  23996 - unusual
  23997 - for
  23998 - her
  23999 - as
  24000 - she
  24001 - wondered
  24002 - whether
  24003 - the
  24004 - artillerists
  24005 - had
  24006 - gone
  24007 - from
  24008 - being
  24009 - moderately
  24010 - honorable

  24023 - resplendent
  24024 - with

  24035 - who
  24036 - lowered

  24039 - a
  24040 - little
  24041 - though

  24044 - much
  24045 - that

  24047 - in

  24050 - would
  24051 - have
  24052 - a

  24059 - with

  24262 - elevator
  24263 - canted
  24264 - over
  24265 - even
  24266 - more
  24267 - till
  24268 - it
  24269 - was
  24270 - almost
  24271 - horizontal
  24272 - and
  24273 - Suzy
  24274 - was
  24275 - sitting
  24276 - on
  24277 - what
  24278 - used
  24279 - to
  24280 - be
  24281 - the
  24282 - wall
  24283 - The
  24284 - Gun-Sergeant
  24285 - said
  24286 - something
  24287 - but
  24288 - Suzy
  24289 - couldn‘t
  24290 - hear
  24291 - it
  24292 - over
  24293 - the
  24294 - ringing
  24295 - in
  24296 - her
  24297 - ears
  24298 - As
  24299 - the
  24300 - tinnitus
  24301 - subsided
  24302 - the
  24303 - Gun-Sergeant
  24304 - spoke
  24305 - again
  24306 - and
  24307 - though
  24308 - Suzy
  24309 - couldn‘t
  24310 - really
  24311 - hear
  24312 - it
  24313 - she
  24314 - could
  24315 - work
  24316 - out
  24317 - what
  24318 - he
  24319 - was
  24320 - saying
  24321 - by
  24322 - watching
  24323 - his
  24324 - lips
  24325 - Told
  24326 - you
  24327 - so
  24328 - he
  24329 - said
  24330 - Suzy
  24331 - grinned
  24332 - and
  24333 - mimed
  24334 - cleaning
  24335 - her
  24336 - ears
  24337 - out
  24338 - with
  24339 - her
  24340 - fingers
  24341 - It
  24342 - actually
  24343 - helped
  24344 - so
  24345 - she
  24346 - kept
  24347 - at
  24348 - it
  24349 - and
  24350 - looked
  24351 - in
  24352 - surprise
  24353 - at
  24354 - her
  24355 - blackened
  24356 - fingertips
  24357 - Must
  24358 - be
  24359 - quite
  24360 - a
  24361 - while

  24367 - between
  24368 - my
  24369 - ears

  24371 - said
  24372 - proudly
  24373 - I
  24374 - don‘t
  24375 - reckon
  24376 - they‘ll
  24377 - get
  24378 - another
  24379 - chance

  24381 - I
  24382 - think
  24383 - it
  24384 - very
  24385 - unlikely

  24387 - Part
  24388 - Six
  24389 - of
  24390 - the
  24391 - Will

  24393 - hopped
  24394 - on
  24395 - to
  24396 - Suzy‘s
  24397 - shoulder
  24398 - and
  24399 - peered
  24400 - at

  24402 - artillerists

  24404 - me
  24405 - Sergeant

  24408 - you
  24409 - all
  24410 - wearing
  24411 - black
  24412 - armbands
  24413 - And
  24414 - what
  24415 - was
  24416 - that
  24417 - explosion

  24419 - The
  24420 - Gun-Sergeant
  24421 - narrowed
  24422 - his
  24423 - eyes
  24424 - I‘m
  24425 - not
  24426 - answering
  24427 - questions
  24428 - from
  24429 - a
  24430 - bird
  24431 - of
  24432 - dubious
  24433 - background

  24435 - said
  24436 - You

  24438 - like

  24444 - I
  24445 - beg

  24483 - What
  24484 - about
  24485 - him

  24487 - asked
  24488 - one
  24489 - of

  24525 - If
  24526 - you
  24527 - say
  24528 - so
  24529 - sniffed

  24531 - gunner
  24532 - but
  24533 - he
  24534 - maintained
  24535 - a

  24538 - with
  24539 - his

  24564 - repeating
  24565 - the

  24567 - question
  24568 - And

  24581 - A

  25747 - the

  25904 - appearance

  25988 - like
  25989 - a

  25991 - up
  25992 - a
  25993 - tree

  26021 - Its
  26022 - green
  26023 - light
  26024 - shone
  26025 - around

  26027 - as

  26029 - moved
  26030 - through
  26031 - this
  26032 - strange
  26033 - darkness
  26034 - that
  26035 - was
  26036 - neither
  26037 - water
  26038 - nor
  26039 - air
  26040 - Like
  26041 - deep-sea
  26042 - creatures
  26043 - drawn
  26044 - to

  26046 - glowing
  26047 - lure

  26049 - Nithlings

  26051 - to
  26052 - the
  26053 - green
  26054 - light

  26056 - first
  26057 - one
  26058 - was
  26059 - a
  26060 - thing
  26061 - that
  26062 - was
  26063 - mostly
  26064 - a
  26065 - giant
  26066 - bird
  26067 - with
  26068 - a
  26069 - vicious
  26070 - beak
  26071 - and
  26072 - metallic
  26073 - feathers
  26074 - though
  26075 - instead
  26076 - of
  26077 - talons
  26078 - it
  26079 - had
  26080 - vastly
  26081 - oversize
  26082 - human
  26083 - hands
  26084 - each
  26085 - with
  26086 - eight
  26087 - fingers
  26088 - and
  26089 - no
  26090 - thumbs

  26092 - speared
  26093 - its
  26094 - beak
  26095 - at
  26096 - the
  26097 - Reaper
  26098 - but
  26099 - he
  26100 - dived
  26101 - under
  26102 - it
  26103 - sweeping
  26104 - up
  26105 - with
  26106 - his
  26107 - scythe
  26108 - to
  26109 - burst
  26110 - through
  26111 - a
  26112 - sudden
  26113 - storm
  26114 - of
  26115 - blood
  26116 - and
  26117 - feathers
  26118 - and
  26119 - continue
  26120 - unslowed
  26121 - The
  26122 - next
  26123 - attack
  26124 - came
  26125 - from
  26126 - a
  26127 - dozen
  26128 - small
  26129 - Nithlings
  26130 - that
  26131 - had
  26132 - the
  26133 - general
  26134 - shape
  26135 - of
  26136 - crabs
  26137 - though
  26138 - each
  26139 - had
  26140 - a
  26141 - human
  26142 - face
  26143 - upon
  26144 - the
  26145 - back
  26146 - of
  26147 - its
  26148 - shell
  26149 - faces
  26150 - that
  26151 - cried
  26152 - and
  26153 - squealed
  26154 - and
  26155 - called
  26156 - out
  26157 - as
  26158 - they
  26159 - scuttled
  26160 - in
  26161 - from
  26162 - all
  26163 - directions—above
  26164 - behind
  26165 - below
  26166 - But
  26167 - again
  26168 - the
  26169 - scythe
  26170 - moved
  26171 - and
  26172 - the
  26173 - Nithlings
  26174 - died
  26175 - and
  26176 - the
  26177 - Reaper
  26178 - and
  26179 - his
  26180 - human
  26181 - burden
  26182 - moved
  26183 - on
  26184 - After
  26185 - the
  26186 - crabs
  26187 - with
  26188 - the
  26189 - human
  26190 - faces
  26191 - there
  26192 - was
  26193 - silence
  26194 - Leaf
  26195 - could
  26196 - not
  26197 - tell
  26198 - how
  26199 - swiftly
  26200 - they
  26201 - were
  26202 - moving
  26203 - for
  26204 - she
  26205 - had
  26206 - no
  26207 - point
  26208 - of
  26209 - reference
  26210 - nor
  26211 - was
  26212 - there
  26213 - any
  26214 - air
  26215 - moving
  26216 - past
  26217 - her
  26218 - face
  26219 - She
  26220 - had
  26221 - a
  26222 - moment
  26223 - of
  26224 - panic
  26225 - as
  26226 - she
  26227 - wondered
  26228 - if
  26229 - in
  26230 - fact
  26231 - there
  26232 - simply
  26233 - was
  26234 - no
  26235 - air
  26236 - and
  26237 - went
  26238 - as
  26239 - far
  26240 - as
  26241 - to
  26242 - lift
  26243 - off
  26244 - her
  26245 - gas
  26246 - mask
  26247 - but
  26248 - even
  26249 - with
  26250 - it
  26251 - off
  26252 - she
  26253 - couldn‘t
  26254 - tell
  26255 - if
  26256 - she
  26257 - was
  26258 - actually
  26259 - breathing
  26260 - in
  26261 - anything
  26262 - or
  26263 - not
  26264 - Still
  26265 - she
  26266 - was
  26267 - alive
  26268 - and
  26269 - if
  26270 - she
  26271 - couldn‘t
  26272 - breathe
  26273 - inside
  26274 - the
  26275 - Front
  26276 - Door
  26277 - she‘d
  26278 - already
  26279 - be
  26280 - dead
  26281 - so
  26282 - there
  26283 - was
  26284 - no
  26285 - point
  26286 - worrying
  26287 - about
  26288 - it
  26289 - –
  26290 - particularly
  26291 - when
  26292 - there
  26293 - were
  26294 - plenty
  26295 - of
  26296 - other
  26297 - things
  26298 - to
  26299 - worry
  26300 - about
  26301 - like
  26302 - where
  26303 - the
  26304 - Reaper
  26305 - might
  26306 - be
  26307 - taking
  26308 - her
  26309 - and
  26310 - for
  26311 - what
  26312 - reason
  26313 - But
  26314 - even
  26315 - that
  26316 - paled
  26317 - into
  26318 - insignificance
  26319 - as
  26320 - Leaf
  26321 - suddenly
  26322 - saw
  26323 - that
  26324 - there
  26325 - was
  26326 - another
  26327 - glow
  26328 - up
  26329 - ahead
  26330 - which
  26331 - looked
  26332 - like
  26333 - it
  26334 - was
  26335 - made
  26336 - by
  26337 - a
  26338 - whole
  26339 - lot
  26340 - of
  26341 - distant
  26342 - lights
  26343 - these
  26344 - were
  26345 - not
  26346 - green
  26347 - but
  26348 - a
  26349 - nasty
  26350 - black-tinted
  26351 - red
  26352 - like
  26353 - the
  26354 - smoky
  26355 - flames
  26356 - from
  26357 - burning
  26358 - rubber

  26366 - out
  26367 - your
  26368 - hand

  26370 - the
  26371 - Reaper

  26373 - had
  26374 - not
  26375 - slowed
  26376 - at
  26377 - all
  26378 - but
  26379 - was
  26380 - charging
  26381 - towards
  26382 - the
  26383 - red
  26384 - light
  26385 - You
  26386 - will
  26387 - also
  26388 - need
  26389 - to
  26390 - fight
  26391 - this
  26392 - time

  26394 - Leaf
  26395 - held
  26396 - out
  26397 - her
  26398 - hand
  26399 - and
  26400 - her
  26401 - fingers
  26402 - closed
  26403 - around
  26404 - the
  26405 - hilt
  26406 - of
  26407 - a
  26408 - sword
  26409 - that
  26410 - appeared
  26411 - from
  26412 - nowhere
  26413 - It
  26414 - was
  26415 - a
  26416 - short
  26417 - sword
  26418 - with
  26419 - a
  26420 - slightly
  26421 - curved
  26422 - blade
  26423 - of
  26424 - blue
  26425 - steel
  26426 - that
  26427 - was
  26428 - broader
  26429 - near
  26430 - the
  26431 - tip
  26432 - than
  26433 - the
  26434 - hilt
  26435 - Faint
  26436 - sparks
  26437 - ran
  26438 - along
  26439 - the
  26440 - blade
  26441 - As
  26442 - Leaf
  26443 - raised
  26444 - the
  26445 - weapon
  26446 - the
  26447 - sparks
  26448 - intensified
  26449 - and
  26450 - she
  26451 - heard
  26452 - a
  26453 - fierce
  26454 - crackling
  26455 - noise
  26456 - rather
  26457 - like
  26458 - the
  26459 - hoarse
  26460 - whispering
  26461 - of

  26469 - in

  26471 - chests
  26472 - said
  26473 - the
  26474 - Reaper
  26475 - Leaf
  26476 - didn‘t
  26477 - know
  26478 - what
  26479 - he
  26480 - was
  26481 - talking
  26482 - about
  26483 - for
  26484 - a
  26485 - few
  26486 - seconds
  26487 - till
  26488 - they
  26489 - got
  26490 - close
  26491 - enough
  26492 - for
  26493 - her
  26494 - to
  26495 - see
  26496 - what
  26497 - was
  26498 - making
  26499 - the
  26500 - red
  26501 - glow
  26502 - Rather
  26503 - than
  26504 - coming
  26505 - from
  26506 - a
  26507 - fire
  26508 - or
  26509 - fires
  26510 - the
  26511 - light
  26512 - was
  26513 - issuing
  26514 - from
  26515 - the
  26516 - chests
  26517 - of
  26518 - a
  26519 - hundred
  26520 - or
  26521 - more
  26522 - Nithlings
  26523 - who
  26524 - were
  26525 - arrayed

  26529 - both
  26530 - on
  26531 - the
  26532 - same
  26533 - plane
  26534 - and
  26535 - above
  26536 - and
  26537 - below
  26538 - These
  26539 - Nithlings
  26540 - had
  26541 - rudimentary
  26542 - wings
  26543 - of
  26544 - leather
  26545 - that
  26546 - they
  26547 - were
  26548 - all
  26549 - flapping
  26550 - wildly
  26551 - but
  26552 - more
  26553 - striking
  26554 - still
  26555 - was
  26556 - that
  26557 - though
  26558 - they
  26559 - were
  26560 - basically
  26561 - humanoid
  26562 - they
  26563 - appeared
  26564 - to
  26565 - have
  26566 - no
  26567 - heads
  26568 - At
  26569 - least
  26570 - they
  26571 - had
  26572 - no
  26573 - heads
  26574 - on
  26575 - their
  26576 - shoulders
  26577 - Leaf
  26578 - saw
  26579 - that
  26580 - the
  26581 - red
  26582 - glow
  26583 - came
  26584 - from
  26585 - their
  26586 - eyes
  26587 - which
  26588 - were
  26589 - in
  26590 - their
  26591 - chests
  26592 - and
  26593 - roughly
  26594 - level
  26595 - with

  26598 - and
  26599 - that
  26600 - was
  26601 - where
  26602 - the
  26603 - rest
  26604 - of
  26605 - their
  26606 - heads
  26607 - were
  26608 - located
  26609 - as
  26610 - well
  26611 - Horrible
  26612 - malformed
  26613 - foreheads
  26614 - noses
  26615 - and
  26616 - chins
  26617 - jutted
  26618 - out
  26619 - from
  26620 - their
  26621 - naked
  26622 - torsos
  26623 - lit
  26624 - by
  26625 - the
  26626 - glow
  26627 - of
  26628 - their
  26629 - red
  26630 - eyes
  26631 - The
  26632 - Reaper
  26633 - seemed
  26634 - unperturbed
  26635 - by
  26636 - their
  26637 - numbers
  26638 - Even
  26639 - as
  26640 - they
  26641 - flapped
  26642 - down
  26643 - up
  26644 - and
  26645 - across
  26646 - to
  26647 - the
  26648 - point
  26649 - of
  26650 - his
  26651 - impact
  26652 - he
  26653 - continued
  26654 - at
  26655 - full
  26656 - speed
  26657 - Though
  26658 - he
  26659 - had
  26660 - no
  26661 - wings
  26662 - Leaf
  26663 - saw
  26664 - that
  26665 - the
  26666 - scythe
  26667 - itself
  26668 - drew
  26669 - him
  26670 - forward
  26671 - as
  26672 - if
  26673 - he
  26674 - were
  26675 - a
  26676 - diver
  26677 - hanging
  26678 - on
  26679 - to
  26680 - a
  26681 - propeller
  26682 - unit
  26683 - When
  26684 - they
  26685 - were
  26686 - only
  26687 - yards
  26688 - away
  26689 - the
  26690 - Nithlings
  26691 - came
  26692 - to
  26693 - meet
  26694 - them
  26695 - scores
  26696 - of
  26697 - them
  26698 - driving
  26699 - straight
  26700 - at
  26701 - their
  26702 - target
  26703 - from
  26704 - all
  26705 - angles
  26706 - Leaf
  26707 - turned
  26708 - half
  26709 - around
  26710 - and
  26711 - swung
  26712 - about
  26713 - her
  26714 - with
  26715 - her
  26716 - sword
  26717 - hacking
  26718 - and
  26719 - slicing
  26720 - in
  26721 - a
  26722 - desperate
  26723 - attempt
  26724 - to
  26725 - keep
  26726 - the
  26727 - Nithlings‘
  26728 - horrible
  26729 - hands
  26730 - from
  26731 - latching
  26732 - on
  26733 - to
  26734 - her
  26735 - and
  26736 - dragging
  26737 - her
  26738 - away
  26739 - The
  26740 - Reaper‘s
  26741 - scythe
  26742 - mowed
  26743 - all
  26744 - around
  26745 - them
  26746 - and
  26747 - then
  26748 - Leaf
  26749 - was
  26750 - striking
  26751 - at
  26752 - air
  26753 - and
  26754 - the
  26755 - Nithlings
  26756 - fell
  26757 - behind
  26758 - unable
  26759 - to
  26760 - keep
  26761 - up
  26762 - Leaf
  26763 - watched
  26764 - the
  26765 - red
  26766 - points
  26767 - of
  26768 - light
  26769 - fade
  26770 - into
  26771 - the
  26772 - distance
  26773 - but
  26774 - held
  26775 - her
  26776 - sword
  26777 - ready
  26778 - her
  26779 - gaze
  26780 - darting
  26781 - around
  26782 - in
  26783 - an
  26784 - attempt
  26785 - to
  26786 - keep
  26787 - every
  26788 - direction
  26789 - covered
  26790 - She
  26791 - also
  26792 - realized
  26793 - that
  26794 - she
  26795 - was
  26796 - holding
  26797 - on
  26798 - even
  26799 - tighter
  26800 - to
  26801 - the
  26802 - Reaper
  26803 - and
  26804 - that
  26805 - if
  26806 - he
  26807 - had
  26808 - been
  26809 - human
  26810 - she
  26811 - would
  26812 - have
  26813 - strangled
  26814 - him
  26815 - long
  26816 - since
  26817 - But
  26818 - he
  26819 - made
  26820 - no
  26821 - complaint
  26822 - Leaf
  26823 - started
  26824 - to
  26825 - ask
  26826 - the
  26827 - Reaper
  26828 - a
  26829 - question
  26830 - but
  26831 - stopped
  26832 - when
  26833 - no
  26834 - sound
  26835 - came
  26836 - out
  26837 - of
  26838 - her
  26839 - mouth
  26840 - She
  26841 - gulped
  26842 - and
  26843 - took
  26844 - a
  26845 - few
  26846 - deep
  26847 - breaths
  26848 - before
  26849 - trying
  26850 - again
  26851 - How…how
  26852 - long
  26853 - till
  26854 - we
  26855 - get
  26856 - out
  26857 - of
  26858 - here
  26859 - ”
  26860 - she
  26861 - asked
  26862 - pleased
  26863 - to
  26864 - hear
  26865 - only
  26866 - a
  26867 - slight
  26868 - tremble
  26869 - in
  26870 - her
  26871 - voice
  26872 - That
  26873 - depends
  26874 - said
  26875 - the
  26876 - Reaper
  26877 - upon
  26878 - our
  26879 - foes
  26880 - ”
  26881 - Right
  26882 - ”
  26883 - Leaf
  26884 - shifted
  26885 - her
  26886 - grip
  26887 - on
  26888 - the
  26889 - sword
  26890 - and
  26891 - looked
  26892 - around
  26893 - again
  26894 - As
  26895 - before
  26896 - everything
  26897 - was
  26898 - dark
  26899 - There
  26900 - was
  26901 - no
  26902 - light
  26903 - save
  26904 - that
  26905 - of
  26906 - the
  26907 - scythe
  26908 - Then
  26909 - she
  26910 - saw
  26911 - something
  26912 - A
  26913 - tiny
  26914 - distant
  26915 - star
  26916 - a
  26917 - pinprick
  26918 - of
  26919 - pure
  26920 - white
  26921 - light
  26922 - They
  26923 - were
  26924 - heading
  26925 - straight
  26926 - towards
  26927 - it
  26928 - and
  26929 - it
  26930 - was
  26931 - growing
  26932 - larger
  26933 - by
  26934 - the
  26935 - second
  26936 - Is
  26937 - that—
  26938 - It
  26939 - is
  26940 - the
  26941 - other
  26942 - side
  26943 - of
  26944 - the
  26945 - Door
  26946 - said
  26947 - the
  26948 - Reaper
  26949 - though
  26950 - in
  26951 - fact
  26952 - Leaf
  26953 - had
  26954 - been
  26955 - about
  26956 - to
  26957 - ask
  26958 - if
  26959 - it
  26960 - was
  26961 - another
  26962 - enemy
  26963 - She
  26964 - felt
  26965 - a
  26966 - surge
  26967 - of
  26968 - relief
  26969 - Somehow
  26970 - even
  26971 - though
  26972 - she
  26973 - knew
  26974 - the
  26975 - Reaper
  26976 - was
  26977 - not
  26978 - her
  26979 - friend
  26980 - she
  26981 - feared
  26982 - him
  26983 - less
  26984 - than
  26985 - whatever
  26986 - unknown
  26987 - Nithlings
  26988 - might
  26989 - appear
  26990 - The
  26991 - relief
  26992 - was
  26993 - very
  26994 - short-lived
  26995 - as
  26996 - the
  26997 - Reaper
  26998 - suddenly
  26999 - changed
  27000 - direction
  27001 - At
  27002 - the
  27003 - same
  27004 - time
  27005 - Leaf
  27006 - thought
  27007 - she
  27008 - heard
  27009 - the
  27010 - echo
  27011 - of
  27012 - a
  27013 - trumpet
  27014 - or
  27015 - another
  27016 - horn
  27017 - of
  27018 - some
  27019 - kind
  27020 - Faint
  27021 - and
  27022 - distant
  27023 - and
  27024 - so
  27025 - low
  27026 - that
  27027 - it
  27028 - might
  27029 - have
  27030 - just
  27031 - been
  27032 - some
  27033 - trick
  27034 - of
  27035 - her
  27036 - ears
  27037 - Where…where
  27038 - are
  27039 - we
  27040 - going
  27041 - ”
  27042 - asked
  27043 - Leaf
  27044 - Her
  27045 - voice
  27046 - was
  27047 - not
  27048 - as
  27049 - steady
  27050 - as
  27051 - she‘d
  27052 - hoped
  27053 - To
  27054 - assist
  27055 - a
  27056 - companion
  27057 - said
  27058 - the
  27059 - Reaper
  27060 - His
  27061 - voice
  27062 - as
  27063 - always
  27064 - was
  27065 - entirely
  27066 - devoid
  27067 - of
  27068 - emotion
  27069 - Leaf
  27070 - heard
  27071 - the
  27072 - trumpet
  27073 - call
  27074 - again
  27075 - as
  27076 - they
  27077 - flew
  27078 - through
  27079 - the
  27080 - strange
  27081 - atmosphere
  27082 - of
  27083 - the
  27084 - Door
  27085 - It
  27086 - grew
  27087 - louder
  27088 - as
  27089 - they
  27090 - travelled
  27091 - indicating
  27092 - that
  27093 - the
  27094 - Reaper
  27095 - was
  27096 - heading
  27097 - directly
  27098 - for
  27099 - whatever
  27100 - was
  27101 - creating
  27102 - the
  27103 - sound
  27104 - It
  27105 - had
  27106 - to
  27107 - be
  27108 - an
  27109 - alarm
  27110 - call
  27111 - of
  27112 - some
  27113 - kind
  27114 - though
  27115 - as
  27116 - usual
  27117 - Leaf
  27118 - couldn‘t
  27119 - see
  27120 - anything
  27121 - in
  27122 - the
  27123 - darkness
  27124 - She
  27125 - kept
  27126 - looking
  27127 - though
  27128 - craning
  27129 - her
  27130 - neck
  27131 - as
  27132 - she
  27133 - tried
  27134 - to
  27135 - cover
  27136 - all
  27137 - possible
  27138 - directions
  27139 - where
  27140 - Nithlings
  27141 - might
  27142 - suddenly
  27143 - appear
  27144 - and
  27145 - attack
  27146 - But
  27147 - no
  27148 - Nithlings
  27149 - did
  27150 - attack
  27151 - and
  27152 - after
  27153 - a
  27154 - little
  27155 - while
  27156 - the
  27157 - trumpet
  27158 - fell
  27159 - silent
  27160 - Leaf
  27161 - wondered
  27162 - how
  27163 - the
  27164 - Reaper
  27165 - knew
  27166 - where
  27167 - to
  27168 - go
  27169 - for
  27170 - he
  27171 - kept
  27172 - up
  27173 - their
  27174 - speed
  27175 - and
  27176 - made
  27177 - small
  27178 - changes
  27179 - of
  27180 - direction
  27181 - from
  27182 - time
  27183 - to
  27184 - time
  27185 - so
  27186 - he
  27187 - clearly
  27188 - had
  27189 - a
  27190 - specific
  27191 - destination
  27192 - in
  27193 - mind
  27194 - Eventually
  27195 - Leaf
  27196 - saw
  27197 - something
  27198 - ahead

  28078 - hill
  28079 - about
  28080 - halfway
  28081 - up
  28082 - and
  28083 - Arthur

  28085 - dragged
  28086 - over
  28087 - rough
  28088 - green
  28089 - turf
  28090 - for

  28116 - green
  28117 - Denizens
  28118 - descended
  28119 - They
  28120 - unhooked
  28121 - Arthur‘s
  28122 - chains

  28126 - tow

  28141 - followed
  28142 - close
  28143 - behind

  28145 - the
  28146 - power
  28147 - of
  28148 - the
  28149 - Seventh
  28150 - Key
  28151 - against

  28153 - while
  28154 - Arthur‘s
  28155 - own
  28156 - Keys
  28157 - struggled
  28158 - to
  28159 - break
  28160 - out
  28161 - of
  28162 - the
  28163 - silver
  28164 - net

  28166 - force
  28167 - of
  28168 - Sunday‘s
  28169 - power
  28170 - pushed
  28171 - Arthur‘s
  28172 - head
  28173 - down
  28174 - and
  28175 - made
  28176 - him
  28177 - feel
  28178 - weak
  28179 - and
  28180 - unable
  28181 - to
  28182 - resist
  28183 - the
  28184 - two
  28185 - Denizens
  28186 - One
  28187 - of
  28188 - them
  28189 - held
  28190 - him
  28191 - while
  28192 - the
  28193 - other
  28194 - fastened
  28195 - the
  28196 - chains
  28197 - to
  28198 - the
  28199 - tips
  28200 - of
  28201 - the
  28202 - clock
  28203 - hands
  28204 - Arthur
  28205 - felt
  28206 - the
  28207 - chains
  28208 - grow
  28209 - shorter
  28210 - like
  28211 - elastic
  28212 - returning
  28213 - to
  28214 - its
  28215 - normal
  28216 - length
  28217 - and
  28218 - they
  28219 - dragged
  28220 - him
  28221 - across
  28222 - the
  28223 - clock
  28224 - face
  28225 - till
  28226 - he
  28227 - had
  28228 - to
  28229 - sit
  28230 - on
  28231 - the
  28232 - central
  28233 - pivot
  28234 - next
  28235 - to
  28236 - the
  28237 - trapdoor
  28238 - Arthur
  28239 - craned
  28240 - his
  28241 - neck
  28242 - to
  28243 - check
  28244 - the
  28245 - position
  28246 - of
  28247 - the
  28248 - hands
  28249 - The
  28250 - hour
  28251 - hand
  28252 - was
  28253 - on
  28254 - the
  28255 - twelve
  28256 - and
  28257 - the
  28258 - minute
  28259 - hand
  28260 - just
  28261 - past
  28262 - it
  28263 - Then
  28264 - he
  28265 - looked
  28266 - at
  28267 - the
  28268 - trapdoor
  28269 - It
  28270 - was
  28271 - shut
  28272 - but
  28273 - he
  28274 - could
  28275 - hear
  28276 - a
  28277 - faint
  28278 - whirring
  28279 - noise
  28280 - behind
  28281 - it
  28282 - and
  28283 - something
  28284 - like
  28285 - a
  28286 - low
  28287 - unpleasant
  28288 - chuckle
  28289 - This
  28290 - is
  28291 - like
  28292 - the
  28293 - Old
  28294 - One‘s
  28295 - clock
  28296 - prison
  28297 - Arthur

  28299 - to
  28300 - Lord
  28301 - Sunday

  28320 - in
  28321 - his

  28350 - almost
  28351 - twelve
  28352 - hours
  28353 - before

  28355 - will
  28356 - emerge

  28677 - Sunday
  28678 - to
  28679 - do
  28680 - the
  28681 - right
  28682 - thing
  28683 - for
  28684 - the
  28685 - House
  28686 - or
  28687 - the
  28688 - Universe…or
  28689 - for
  28690 - me
  28691 - I
  28692 - don‘t
  28693 - even
  28694 - know
  28695 - what
  28696 - his
  28697 - plans
  28698 - really
  28699 - are
  28700 - or
  28701 - why
  28702 - he
  28703 - has
  28704 - let
  28705 - Saturday
  28706 - destroy
  28707 - the
  28708 - House
  28709 - There‘s
  28710 - no
  28711 - way
  28712 - he
  28713 - could
  28714 - leave
  28715 - me
  28716 - alone
  28717 - not
  28718 - now
  28719 - I
  28720 - have
  28721 - come
  28722 - too
  28723 - far
  28724 - and
  28725 - I
  28726 - have
  28727 - changed
  28728 - too
  28729 - much
  28730 - to
  28731 - go
  28732 - back
  28733 - I
  28734 - have
  28735 - to
  28736 - see
  28737 - this
  28738 - through
  28739 - I‘ll
  28740 - use
  28741 - the
  28742 - medal
  28743 - to
  28744 - call
  28745 - the
  28746 - Mariner
  28747 - and
  28748 - hope
  28749 - he
  28750 - gets
  28751 - here
  28752 - before
  28753 - the
  28754 - clock
  28755 - strikes
  28756 - twelve…
  28757 - Arthur‘s
  28758 - hand
  28759 - fell
  28760 - to
  28761 - the
  28762 - pouch
  28763 - at
  28764 - his
  28765 - waist
  28766 - as
  28767 - he
  28768 - thought
  28769 - this
  28770 - and
  28771 - he
  28772 - saw
  28773 - Lord
  28774 - Sunday‘s
  28775 - eyes
  28776 - follow
  28777 - the
  28778 - movement
  28779 - Instantly
  28780 - Arthur
  28781 - lifted
  28782 - his
  28783 - hand
  28784 - to
  28785 - scratch
  28786 - his
  28787 - nose
  28788 - the
  28789 - chain
  28790 - clanking
  28791 - as
  28792 - he
  28793 - moved
  28794 - But
  28795 - it
  28796 - was
  28797 - too
  28798 - late
  28799 - Sunday‘s
  28800 - attention
  28801 - was
  28802 - on
  28803 - the
  28804 - pouch
  28805 - The
  28806 - Trustee
  28807 - lifted
  28808 - his
  28809 - hand
  28810 - slightly
  28811 - and
  28812 - Arthur‘s
  28813 - belt
  28814 - broke
  28815 - apart
  28816 - the
  28817 - pouch
  28818 - sailing
  28819 - across
  28820 - the
  28821 - intervening
  28822 - space
  28823 - to
  28824 - land
  28825 - at
  28826 - Sunday‘s
  28827 - feet
  28828 - Waterless
  28829 - soap
  28830 - a
  28831 - cleaning
  28832 - cloth

  28835 - several
  28836 - nuts

  28841 - all-
  28842 - important
  28843 - silver
  28844 - bag
  28845 - fell
  28846 - out
  28847 - Sunday
  28848 - gestured
  28849 - again
  28850 - and
  28851 - the
  28852 - silver
  28853 - bag
  28854 - spewed
  28855 - out
  28856 - it
  28857 - contents
  28858 - A
  28859 - Complete
  28860 - Atlas

  28870 - Mariner‘s
  28871 - medal
  28872 - The
  28873 - Atlas
  28874 - disappeared
  28875 - as
  28876 - it
  28877 - touched
  28878 - the
  28879 - grass
  28880 - Arthur
  28881 - jumped
  28882 - as
  28883 - it
  28884 - reappeared
  28885 - a
  28886 - moment
  28887 - later
  28888 - inside
  28889 - the
  28890 - front
  28891 - of
  28892 - his
  28893 - coveralls
  28894 - Like
  28895 - the
  28896 - Keys

  28898 - Atlas

  28925 - to
  28926 - give
  28927 - you
  28928 - the
  28929 - comfort
  28930 - of
  28931 - them
  28932 - Noon
  28933 - take
  28934 - these
  28935 - things
  28936 - and

  28943 - Arthur
  28944 - could
  28945 - only
  28946 - watch
  28947 - as
  28948 - the
  28949 - slightly
  28950 - taller
  28951 - of
  28952 - the
  28953 - two
  28954 - green
  28955 - Denizens
  28956 - scooped
  28957 - up
  28958 - the
  28959 - elephant
  28960 - and
  28961 - the
  28962 - medal
  28963 - and
  28964 - threw
  28965 - them
  28966 - away
  28967 - The
  28968 - items
  28969 - separated
  28970 - as
  28971 - they
  28972 - flew
  28973 - through
  28974 - the
  28975 - air
  28976 - the
  28977 - elephant
  28978 - on
  28979 - a
  28980 - high
  28981 - arc
  28982 - that
  28983 - ended
  28984 - suddenly
  28985 - as
  28986 - it
  28987 - landed
  28988 - in
  28989 - the
  28990 - high
  28991 - branches
  28992 - of
  28993 - a
  28994 - tree
  28995 - the
  28996 - medal
  28997 - going
  28998 - lower
  28999 - and
  29000 - further
  29001 - travelling
  29002 - several
  29003 - hundred
  29004 - yards
  29005 - before

  29010 - level
  29011 - of
  29012 - the
  29013 - terrace

  29018 - of
  29019 - the
  29020 - medal‘s
  29021 - fall

  29023 - with

  29061 - He
  29062 - stepped
  29063 - off
  29064 - the
  29065 - horizontal
  29066 - clock
  29067 - face
  29068 - and
  29069 - walked
  29070 - away
  29071 - but
  29072 - not
  29073 - to
  29074 - the
  29075 - dragonfly‘s
  29076 - rope
  29077 - ladder

  29079 - Arthur
  29080 - watched
  29081 - him
  29082 - cross
  29083 - to
  29084 - the
  29085 - rear
  29086 - of
  29087 - the
  29088 - terrace

  29090 - a

  29092 - of
  29093 - steps
  29094 - wound
  29095 - up

  29103 - three
  29104 - were
  29105 - on
  29106 - the
  29107 - steps
  29108 - when
  29109 - a
  29110 - bright
  29111 - blue-and-red
  29112 - bird
  29113 - shot
  29114 - past

  29118 - in
  29119 - front
  29120 - of
  29121 - Lord
  29122 - Sunday
  29123 - hovering
  29124 - in
  29125 - place
  29126 - its
  29127 - wings
  29128 - beating
  29129 - so
  29130 - fast
  29131 - they
  29132 - were
  29133 - a
  29134 - blur

  29136 - held
  29137 - out
  29138 - a
  29139 - finger
  29140 - the
  29141 - bird
  29142 - hopped
  29143 - on
  29144 - to
  29145 - it
  29146 - and
  29147 - was
  29148 - carried
  29149 - to
  29150 - his
  29151 - shoulder
  29152 - where
  29153 - it
  29154 - spoke
  29155 - into
  29156 - his
  29157 - ear
  29158 - in
  29159 - a
  29160 - high-pitched
  29161 - voice
  29162 - that
  29163 - Arthur
  29164 - could
  29165 - almost
  29166 - hear
  29167 - but
  29168 - not
  29169 - well
  29170 - enough
  29171 - to
  29172 - make
  29173 - out
  29174 - more
  29175 - than

  29182 - The
  29183 - bird
  29184 - finished
  29185 - talking
  29186 - Sunday
  29187 - nodded
  29188 - once
  29189 - and
  29190 - it
  29191 - flew
  29192 - away
  29193 - back
  29194 - down
  29195 - the
  29196 - hill
  29197 - Sunday
  29198 - turned
  29199 - around
  29200 - and
  29201 - looked
  29202 - at
  29203 - Arthur
  29204 - It
  29205 - seems
  29206 - you
  29207 - are
  29208 - not
  29209 - the
  29210 - only
  29211 - recalcitrant
  29212 - who
  29213 - cannot
  29214 - acknowledge
  29215 - the
  29216 - realities

  29237 - With
  29238 - that

  29240 - handed
  29241 - the
  29242 - silver
  29243 - net
  29244 - to
  29245 - Sunday‘s
  29246 - Noon

  29248 - held
  29249 - it
  29250 - with
  29251 - both
  29252 - hands
  29253 - It
  29254 - obviously
  29255 - took
  29256 - a
  29257 - lot
  29258 - of
  29259 - effort
  29260 - to
  29261 - keep
  29262 - it
  29263 - relatively
  29264 - still
  29265 - as
  29266 - the
  29267 - Keys
  29268 - jumped
  29269 - around
  29270 - inside
  29271 - straining
  29272 - to
  29273 - reach
  29274 - Arthur

  29284 - placed
  29285 - his

  29287 - just
  29288 - above
  29289 - his
  29290 - breastbone
  29291 - touching
  29292 - the
  29293 - Key
  29294 - that
  29295 - hung
  29296 - from
  29297 - a

  29301 - neck
  29302 - hidden
  29303 - inside

  29346 - Sunday
  29347 - retraced

  29349 - steps
  29350 - back
  29351 - down
  29352 - to
  29353 - the

  29358 - Dawn

  29372 - watch

  29380 - depart
  29381 - from
  29382 - the
  29383 - corner
  29384 - of

  29389 - intent
  29390 - upon
  29391 - Sunday‘s
  29392 - Noon
  29393 - and
  29394 - watched
  29395 - him
  29396 - as

  29398 - carefully
  29399 - carried
  29400 - the

  29413 - the
  29414 - next
  29415 - terrace
  29416 - and
  29417 - out
  29418 - of
  29419 - Arthur‘s
  29420 - sight
  29421 - A
  29422 - few
  29423 - minutes
  29424 - later
  29425 - the
  29426 - dragonfly
  29427 - was
  29428 - away
  29429 - turning
  29430 - to
  29431 - climb
  29432 - up
  29433 - and
  29434 - over
  29435 - the
  29436 - hill
  29437 - Arthur
  29438 - was
  29439 - alone
  29440 - chained
  29441 - to
  29442 - the
  29443 - clock
  29444 - He
  29445 - could
  29446 - see
  29447 - only
  29448 - as
  29449 - far
  29450 - as
  29451 - the
  29452 - nearest
  29453 - hundred-foot-high
  29454 - hedge
  29455 - below
  29456 - the
  29457 - hill
  29458 - and
  29459 - the
  29460 - slope
  29461 - of
  29462 - the
  29463 - terrace
  29464 - behind
  29465 - him
  29466 - The
  29467 - clock
  29468 - ticked
  29469 - –
  29470 - a
  29471 - sound
  29472 - like
  29473 - the
  29474 - sharp
  29475 - stroke
  29476 - of
  29477 - an
  29478 - axe
  29479 - on
  29480 - very
  29481 - hard
  29482 - wood
  29483 - The
  29484 - minute
  29485 - hand
  29486 - swept
  29487 - forward
  29488 - and
  29489 - the
  29490 - chain
  29491 - on
  29492 - Arthur‘s
  29493 - left
  29494 - wrist
  29495 - rattled
  29496 - as
  29497 - it
  29498 - too
  29499 - moved
  29500 - Arthur
  29501 - bit
  29502 - his
  29503 - lip
  29504 - and
  29505 - tried
  29506 - to
  29507 - think
  29508 - The
  29509 - medal
  29510 - was
  29511 - gone
  29512 - but
  29513 - there
  29514 - had
  29515 - to
  29516 - be
  29517 - something
  29518 - else
  29519 - he
  29520 - could
  29521 - do
  29522 - There
  29523 - was
  29524 - the
  29525 - chance
  29526 - that
  29527 - Dame
  29528 - Primus
  29529 - or
  29530 - Dr
  29531 - Scamandros
  29532 - might
  29533 - be
  29534 - able
  29535 - to
  29536 - rescue
  29537 - him
  29538 - but
  29539 - even
  29540 - as
  29541 - he
  29542 - thought
  29543 - that
  29544 - he
  29545 - dismissed
  29546 - it
  29547 - His
  29548 - only
  29549 - real
  29550 - chance
  29551 - would
  29552 - be
  29553 - if
  29554 - he
  29555 - could
  29556 - do
  29557 - something
  29558 - himself
  29559 - He
  29560 - had
  29561 - to
  29562 - regain
  29563 - the
  29564 - Keys
  29565 - or
  29566 - free
  29567 - Part
  29568 - Seven
  29569 - of
  29570 - the
  29571 - Will
  29572 - or
  29573 - somehow
  29574 - retrieve
  29575 - the
  29576 - Mariner‘s
  29577 - medal
  29578 - The
  29579 - clock
  29580 - ticked
  29581 - again
  29582 - the
  29583 - hand
  29584 - moved
  29585 - and
  29586 - the
  29587 - chain
  29588 - rattled
  29589 - Arthur
  29590 - stood
  29591 - up
  29592 - and
  29593 - looked
  29594 - around
  29595 - He
  29596 - couldn‘t
  29597 - see
  29598 - where
  29599 - the
  29600 - medal
  29601 - had
  29602 - landed
  29603 - The
  29604 - only
  29605 - thing
  29606 - he
  29607 - could
  29608 - see
  29609 - was
  29610 - his
  29611 - yellow
  29612 - elephant
  29613 - stuck
  29614 - in
  29615 - the
  29616 - upper
  29617 - branches
  29618 - of
  29619 - a
  29620 - tall
  29621 - tree
  29622 - that
  29623 - reached
  29624 - up
  29625 - from
  29626 - the
  29627 - next
  29628 - terrace
  29629 - further
  29630 - down
  29631 - the
  29632 - hill
  29633 - The
  29634 - elephant
  29635 - looked
  29636 - like
  29637 - a
  29638 - strange
  29639 - fruit
  29640 - the
  29641 - bright
  29642 - yellow
  29643 - a
  29644 - stark
  29645 - contrast
  29646 - against
  29647 - the
  29648 - tree‘s
  29649 - pale
  29650 - green
  29651 - leaves
  29652 - I
  29653 - wish
  29654 - you
  29655 - could
  29656 - help
  29657 - me
  29658 - thought
  29659 - Arthur
  29660 - Elephant
  29661 - you
  29662 - were
  29663 - always
  29664 - there
  29665 - to
  29666 - help
  29667 - me
  29668 - out
  29669 - when
  29670 - I
  29671 - was
  29672 - little
  29673 - even
  29674 - if
  29675 - it
  29676 - was
  29677 - only
  29678 - in
  29679 - my
  29680 - imagination…
  29681 - Arthur
  29682 - looked
  29683 - away
  29684 - from
  29685 - Elephant
  29686 - down
  29687 - at
  29688 - the
  29689 - clock
  29690 - face
  29691 - and
  29692 - then
  29693 - at
  29694 - the
  29695 - green
  29696 - grass
  29697 - of
  29698 - the
  29699 - terrace
  29700 - The
  29701 - Old
  29702 - One
  29703 - conjured
  29704 - stuff
  29705 - out
  29706 - of
  29707 - Nothing
  29708 - when
  29709 - I
  29710 - first
  29711 - met
  29712 - him
  29713 - Arthur
  29714 - thought
  29715 - He
  29716 - said
  29717 - I‘d
  29718 - need
  29719 - a
  29720 - Key
  29721 - to
  29722 - do
  29723 - it
  29724 - but
  29725 - that
  29726 - was
  29727 - ages
  29728 - ago
  29729 - before
  29730 - my
  29731 - transformation
  29732 - I
  29733 - might
  29734 - be
  29735 - able
  29736 - to
  29737 - make
  29738 - things
  29739 - from
  29740 - Nothing
  29741 - here
  29742 - He
  29743 - laid
  29744 - his
  29745 - hand
  29746 - on
  29747 - the
  29748 - clock
  29749 - He
  29750 - couldn‘t
  29751 - feel
  29752 - any
  29753 - interstices
  29754 - of
  29755 - Nothing
  29756 - lurking
  29757 - somewhere
  29758 - underneath
  29759 - as
  29760 - was
  29761 - usual
  29762 - in
  29763 - other
  29764 - parts
  29765 - of
  29766 - the
  29767 - House
  29768 - and
  29769 - it
  29770 - was
  29771 - likely
  29772 - the
  29773 - Incomparable
  29774 - Gardens
  29775 - were
  29776 - completely
  29777 - armored
  29778 - against
  29779 - the
  29780 - Void
  29781 - but
  29782 - it
  29783 - was
  29784 - worth
  29785 - a
  29786 - try
  29787 - Anything
  29788 - was
  29789 - worth
  29790 - a
  29791 - try
  29792 - A
  29793 - telephone
  29794 - connected
  29795 - to
  29796 - the
  29797 - Citadel
  29798 - in
  29799 - the
  29800 - Great
  29801 - Maze
  29802 - said
  29803 - Arthur
  29804 - firmly
  29805 - At
  29806 - the
  29807 - same
  29808 - time
  29809 - he
  29810 - visualized
  29811 - the
  29812 - telephone
  29813 - Dame
  29814 - Primus
  29815 - had
  29816 - given
  29817 - him
  29818 - long
  29819 - ago
  29820 - in
  29821 - the
  29822 - red
  29823 - box
  29824 - He
  29825 - tried
  29826 - to
  29827 - picture
  29828 - it
  29829 - in
  29830 - his
  29831 - head
  29832 - as
  29833 - solidly
  29834 - as
  29835 - possible
  29836 - but
  29837 - he
  29838 - felt
  29839 - none
  29840 - of
  29841 - the
  29842 - symptoms
  29843 - of
  29844 - House
  29845 - sorcery
  29846 - Though
  29847 - these
  29848 - aches
  29849 - and
  29850 - pains
  29851 - were
  29852 - always
  29853 - unpleasant
  29854 - and
  29855 - sometimes
  29856 - extraordinarily
  29857 - intense
  29858 - he
  29859 - would
  29860 - have
  29861 - welcomed
  29862 - them
  29863 - if
  29864 - it
  29865 - meant
  29866 - his
  29867 - attempts
  29868 - to
  29869 - make
  29870 - a
  29871 - telephone
  29872 - from
  29873 - Nothing
  29874 - were
  29875 - successful
  29876 - A
  29877 - telephone
  29878 - connected
  29879 - to
  29880 - other
  29881 - parts
  29882 - of
  29883 - the
  29884 - House
  29885 - ”
  29886 - he
  29887 - said
  29888 - again
  29889 - snapping
  29890 - his
  29891 - words
  29892 - as
  29893 - if
  29894 - he
  29895 - spoke
  29896 - to
  29897 - some
  29898 - recalcitrant
  29899 - servant
  29900 - But
  29901 - still
  29902 - he
  29903 - felt
  29904 - no
  29905 - sorcery
  29906 - and
  29907 - no
  29908 - telephone
  29909 - appeared
  29910 - Arthur
  29911 - tried
  29912 - to
  29913 - call
  29914 - up
  29915 - the
  29916 - rage
  29917 - he‘d
  29918 - felt
  29919 - in
  29920 - his
  29921 - house
  29922 - when
  29923 - he‘d
  29924 - smashed
  29925 - the
  29926 - table
  29927 - hoping
  29928 - that
  29929 - energy
  29930 - might
  29931 - somehow
  29932 - fuel
  29933 - his
  29934 - attempt
  29935 - to
  29936 - draw
  29937 - something
  29938 - out
  29939 - of
  29940 - Nothing
  29941 - But
  29942 - he
  29943 - didn‘t
  29944 - feel
  29945 - angry
  29946 - and
  29947 - he
  29948 - couldn‘t
  29949 - recapture
  29950 - the
  29951 - emotion
  29952 - He
  29953 - just
  29954 - felt
  29955 - drained
  29956 - and
  29957 - defeated
  29958 - and
  29959 - small
  29960 - All
  29961 - of
  29962 - his
  29963 - triumphant
  29964 - powerful
  29965 - feelings
  29966 - were
  29967 - completely
  29968 - gone
  29969 - lost
  29970 - the
  29971 - moment
  29972 - he
  29973 - was
  29974 - chained
  29975 - by
  29976 - Lord
  29977 - Sunday
  29978 - and
  29979 - his
  29980 - servants
  29981 - Maybe
  29982 - a
  29983 - telephone
  29984 - is
  29985 - too
  29986 - tricky
  29987 - Arthur
  29988 - said
  29989 - to
  29990 - himself
  29991 - Or
  29992 - the
  29993 - connections
  29994 - are
  29995 - difficult…but
  29996 - what
  29997 - else
  29998 - could
  29999 - help
  30000 - now
  30001 - ”
  30002 - He
  30003 - thought
  30004 - about
  30005 - bolt
  30006 - cutters
  30007 - or
  30008 - a
  30009 - hacksaw
  30010 - but
  30011 - they
  30012 - would
  30013 - be
  30014 - useless
  30015 - against
  30016 - the
  30017 - sorcerous
  30018 - metal
  30019 - of
  30020 - the
  30021 - manacles
  30022 - In
  30023 - fact
  30024 - apart
  30025 - from
  30026 - the
  30027 - Mariner‘s
  30028 - harpoon
  30029 - or
  30030 - the
  30031 - Keys
  30032 - Arthur
  30033 - couldn‘t
  30034 - think
  30035 - of
  30036 - anything
  30037 - that
  30038 - would
  30039 - have
  30040 - any
  30041 - effect
  30042 - upon
  30043 - his
  30044 - bonds
  30045 - What
  30046 - I
  30047 - really
  30048 - need
  30049 - is
  30050 - some
  30051 - way
  30052 - to
  30053 - get
  30054 - the
  30055 - medal
  30056 - back
  30057 - It‘s
  30058 - only
  30059 - down
  30060 - the
  30061 - slope
  30062 - I
  30063 - need
  30064 - a
  30065 - retriever
  30066 - dog
  30067 - or
  30068 - something…a
  30069 - smart
  30070 - animal
  30071 - who
  30072 - will
  30073 - do
  30074 - what
  30075 - it‘s
  30076 - told
  30077 - I
  30078 - wish
  30079 - Elephant
  30080 - was
  30081 - real
  30082 - just
  30083 - like
  30084 - I
  30085 - thought
  30086 - he
  30087 - was
  30088 - when
  30089 - I
  30090 - was
  30091 - four…
  30092 - Arthur
  30093 - smiled
  30094 - to
  30095 - himself
  30096 - remembering
  30097 - how
  30098 - real
  30099 - Elephant
  30100 - had
  30101 - been
  30102 - and
  30103 - the
  30104 - conversations
  30105 - he‘d
  30106 - had
  30107 - with
  30108 - Emily
  30109 - recounting
  30110 - what
  30111 - Elephant
  30112 - had
  30113 - done
  30114 - that
  30115 - day
  30116 - sometimes
  30117 - adopting
  30118 - Elephant‘s
  30119 - voice
  30120 - and
  30121 - manipulating
  30122 - his
  30123 - trunk
  30124 - to
  30125 - make
  30126 - him
  30127 - talk
  30128 - A
  30129 - sudden
  30130 - jab
  30131 - of
  30132 - pain
  30133 - ran
  30134 - through
  30135 - Arthur‘s
  30136 - joints
  30137 - from
  30138 - ankle
  30139 - to
  30140 - shoulder
  30141 - and
  30142 - something
  30143 - touched
  30144 - his
  30145 - arm
  30146 - He
  30147 - yelped
  30148 - and
  30149 - sprang
  30150 - to
  30151 - his
  30152 - feet
  30153 - thinking
  30154 - of
  30155 - a
  30156 - puppet
  30157 - woodcutter
  30158 - and
  30159 - his
  30160 - axe
  30161 - or
  30162 - even
  30163 - worse
  30164 - the
  30165 - old
  30166 - woman
  30167 - puppet
  30168 - with
  30169 - her
  30170 - corkscrew
  30171 - But
  30172 - the
  30173 - trapdoor
  30174 - was
  30175 - shut
  30176 - and
  30177 - the
  30178 - touch
  30179 - when
  30180 - it
  30181 - came
  30182 - again
  30183 - to
  30184 - his
  30185 - knee
  30186 - was
  30187 - light
  30188 - a
  30189 - gentle
  30190 - tap
  30191 - that
  30192 - came
  30193 - from
  30194 - the
  30195 - trunk
  30196 - of
  30197 - a
  30198 - small
  30199 - yellow
  30200 - elephant
  30201 - whose
  30202 - twinkling
  30203 - jet-black
  30204 - eyes
  30205 - looked
  30206 - up
  30207 - at
  30208 - Arthur
  30209 - with
  30210 - wisdom
  30211 - and
  30212 - affection
  30213 - Arthur
  30214 - crouched
  30215 - down
  30216 - and
  30217 - cradled
  30218 - his
  30219 - lifelong
  30220 - friend
  30221 - biting
  30222 - his
  30223 - lip
  30224 - to
  30225 - hold
  30226 - back
  30227 - the
  30228 - sobs
  30229 - that
  30230 - were
  30231 - so
  30232 - near
  30233 - to
  30234 - breaking
  30235 - out
  30236 - Elephant
  30237 - waited
  30238 - patiently
  30239 - till
  30240 - Arthur
  30241 - had
  30242 - composed
  30243 - himself
  30244 - enough
  30245 - to
  30246 - sit
  30247 - back
  30248 - The
  30249 - boy
  30250 - looked
  30251 - up
  30252 - at
  30253 - the
  30254 - tree
  30255 - where
  30256 - the
  30257 - toy
  30258 - had
  30259 - lodged
  30260 - It
  30261 - was
  30262 - gone
  30263 - and
  30264 - the
  30265 - elephant
  30266 - next
  30267 - to
  30268 - him
  30269 - was
  30270 - definitely
  30271 - a
  30272 - living
  30273 - breathing
  30274 - version
  30275 - of
  30276 - his
  30277 - childhood
  30278 - companion
  30279 - I‘ve
  30280 - made
  30281 - a
  30282 - Nithling
  30283 - thought
  30284 - Arthur
  30285 - and
  30286 - he
  30287 - supposed
  30288 - he
  30289 - should
  30290 - be
  30291 - afraid
  30292 - of
  30293 - what
  30294 - he‘d
  30295 - done
  30296 - But
  30297 - he
  30298 - wasn‘t
  30299 - He
  30300 - was
  30301 - happy
  30302 - He
  30303 - was
  30304 - no
  30305 - longer
  30306 - alone
  30307 - and
  30308 - even
  30309 - better
  30310 - than
  30311 - that
  30312 - now
  30313 - he
  30314 - had
  30315 - an
  30316 - ally
  30317 - I‘m
  30318 - so
  30319 - glad
  30320 - to
  30321 - see
  30322 - you
  30323 - Elephant
  30324 - he
  30325 - said
  30326 - I
  30327 - need
  30328 - your
  30329 - help
  30330 - really
  30331 - badly
  30332 - There‘s
  30333 - a
  30334 - silver
  30335 - medal
  30336 - about
  30337 - this
  30338 - big
  30339 - somewhere
  30340 - down
  30341 - the
  30342 - slope
  30343 - of
  30344 - the
  30345 - hill
  30346 - in
  30347 - that
  30348 - direction
  30349 - I
  30350 - need
  30351 - you
  30352 - to
  30353 - go
  30354 - and
  30355 - get
  30356 - it
  30357 - please
  30358 - and
  30359 - bring
  30360 - it
  30361 - back
  30362 - to
  30363 - me
  30364 - But
  30365 - be
  30366 - careful
  30367 - Even
  30368 - the
  30369 - plants
  30370 - can
  30371 - be
  30372 - dangerous
  30373 - –
  30374 - we
  30375 - have
  30376 - many
  30377 - enemies
  30378 - here
  30379 - ”
  30380 - Elephant
  30381 - nodded
  30382 - sagely
  30383 - and
  30384 - raised
  30385 - his
  30386 - trunk
  30387 - to
  30388 - blow
  30389 - a
  30390 - soft
  30391 - trumpet
  30392 - blast
  30393 - of
  30394 - affirmation
  30395 - Then
  30396 - he
  30397 - jumped
  30398 - down
  30399 - from
  30400 - the
  30401 - clock
  30402 - face
  30403 - and
  30404 - strode
  30405 - off
  30406 - through
  30407 - the
  30408 - grass
  30409 - towards
  30410 - the
  30411 - edge
  30412 - of
  30413 - the
  30414 - terrace
  30415 - CHAPTER
  30416 - TWELVE
  30417 - Fortunately
  30418 - for
  30419 - all
  30420 - concerned
  30421 - the
  30422 - tile
  30423 - did
  30424 - take
  30425 - Suzy
  30426 - Dusk
  30427 - Giac
  30428 - Part
  30429 - Six
  30430 - of

  30433 - and
  30434 - two
  30435 - score
  30436 - artillerists
  30437 - to
  30438 - a
  30439 - position
  30440 - adjacent
  30441 - to
  30442 - the
  30443 - Citadel
  30444 - There
  30445 - they
  30446 - met
  30447 - one
  30448 - of
  30449 - the
  30450 - rearguard
  30451 - guides
  30452 - who
  30453 - led
  30454 - them
  30455 - quickly
  30456 - past
  30457 - a
  30458 - gaping
  30459 - hole
  30460 - of
  30461 - Nothing
  30462 - that
  30463 - was
  30464 - slowly
  30465 - and
  30466 - inexorably
  30467 - spreading
  30468 - like
  30469 - ink
  30470 - across
  30471 - blotting
  30472 - paper
  30473 - and
  30474 - on
  30475 - to
  30476 - the
  30477 - Citadel
  30478 - itself
  30479 - through
  30480 - the
  30481 - abandoned
  30482 - trenches
  30483 - and
  30484 - firewash-blackened
  30485 - ground
  30486 - left
  30487 - by
  30488 - the
  30489 - Newniths‘
  30490 - siege
  30491 - The
  30492 - great
  30493 - fortress
  30494 - was
  30495 - strangely
  30496 - quiet
  30497 - its
  30498 - buildings
  30499 - abandoned
  30500 - A
  30501 - winding
  30502 - column
  30503 - of
  30504 - black
  30505 - smoke
  30506 - rose
  30507 - from
  30508 - the
  30509 - lakeside
  30510 - bastion
  30511 - which
  30512 - had
  30513 - been
  30514 - set
  30515 - on
  30516 - fire
  30517 - to
  30518 - destroy
  30519 - the
  30520 - last
  30521 - of
  30522 - the
  30523 - stores
  30524 - that
  30525 - could
  30526 - not
  30527 - be
  30528 - taken
  30529 - up
  30530 - to
  30531 - the
  30532 - Middle
  30533 - House
  30534 - The
  30535 - guide
  30536 - took
  30537 - them
  30538 - to
  30539 - the
  30540 - central
  30541 - keep
  30542 - by
  30543 - the
  30544 - shortest
  30545 - path
  30546 - one
  30547 - that
  30548 - would
  30549 - normally
  30550 - be
  30551 - blocked
  30552 - by
  30553 - sealed
  30554 - gates
  30555 - portcullises
  30556 - and
  30557 - heavy
  30558 - doors
  30559 - But
  30560 - all
  30561 - the
  30562 - Citadel‘s
  30563 - portals
  30564 - and
  30565 - defences
  30566 - were
  30567 - open
  30568 - now
  30569 - and
  30570 - the
  30571 - few
  30572 - sentries
  30573 - remaining
  30574 - left
  30575 - their
  30576 - posts
  30577 - to
  30578 - join
  30579 - the
  30580 - party
  30581 - as
  30582 - they
  30583 - passed
  30584 - though
  30585 - they
  30586 - kept
  30587 - a
  30588 - wary
  30589 - eye
  30590 - out
  30591 - to
  30592 - the
  30593 - rear
  30594 - watching
  30595 - for
  30596 - any
  30597 - of
  30598 - the
  30599 - old-fashioned
  30600 - type
  30601 - of
  30602 - free-willed
  30603 - Nithling
  30604 - that
  30605 - might
  30606 - try
  30607 - to
  30608 - follow
  30609 - as
  30610 - many
  30611 - of
  30612 - these
  30613 - creatures
  30614 - were
  30615 - beginning
  30616 - to
  30617 - emerge
  30618 - from
  30619 - the
  30620 - pools
  30621 - and
  30622 - pockets
  30623 - of
  30624 - Nothing
  30625 - that
  30626 - were
  30627 - bubbling
  30628 - up
  30629 - all
  30630 - around
  30631 - the
  30632 - Citadel
  30633 - The
  30634 - soldiers
  30635 - who
  30636 - had
  30637 - already
  30638 - departed
  30639 - for
  30640 - the
  30641 - Middle
  30642 - House
  30643 - had
  30644 - left
  30645 - a
  30646 - lot
  30647 - of
  30648 - nonessential
  30649 - items
  30650 - behind
  30651 - for

  30654 - packs
  30655 - bags
  30656 - chests
  30657 - and
  30658 - boxes
  30659 - pushed
  30660 - to
  30661 - the
  30662 - sides
  30663 - of
  30664 - many
  30665 - of

  30670 - Along
  30671 - the
  30672 - way
  30673 - Suzy
  30674 - snagged
  30675 - a
  30676 - Regimental
  30677 - Brigadier
  30678 - General‘s

  30848 - of
  30849 - uniforms
  30850 - favored

  30892 - of

  30895 - reaching
  30896 - into
  30897 - the
  30898 - barrel
  30899 - which
  30900 - was
  30901 - stuffed
  30902 - to
  30903 - the
  30904 - brim
  30905 - with
  30906 - biscuits
  30907 - Since

  30913 - needed
  30914 - to
  30915 - eat
  30916 - but
  30917 - liked
  30918 - to
  30919 - do
  30920 - so
  30921 - anyway
  30922 - it
  30923 - was
  30924 - surprising
  30925 - that
  30926 - the
  30927 - barrel
  30928 - was
  30929 - marked
  30930 - ESSENTIAL

  30934 - Suzy

  30936 - the
  30937 - raisin-filled
  30938 - biscuit
  30939 - with
  30940 - glee
  30941 - and

  30962 - Giac
  30963 - beamed
  30964 - repeating
  30965 - his

  30967 - rank
  30968 - to
  30969 - himself

  30983 - Suzy
  30984 - She
  30985 - swallowed
  30986 - and
  30987 - said
  30988 - Who‘ll

  31029 - Part
  31030 - Six
  31031 - of
  31032 - the
  31033 - Will
  31034 - looked
  31035 - at
  31036 - her
  31037 - with
  31038 - one
  31039 - beady
  31040 - eye
  31041 - I
  31042 - will

  31065 - asked
  31066 - Suzy

  31068 - shrugged
  31069 - The
  31070 - Maze
  31071 - is
  31072 - falling
  31073 - apart
  31074 - we‘re
  31075 - all

  31090 - Suzy
  31091 - was
  31092 - about
  31093 - to
  31094 - ask
  31095 - another
  31096 - question
  31097 - when
  31098 - the
  31099 - elevator
  31100 - juddered
  31101 - into
  31102 - movement
  31103 - and
  31104 - everybody
  31105 - stumbled
  31106 - into
  31107 - everyone
  31108 - else
  31109 - which
  31110 - was
  31111 - very
  31112 - painful
  31113 - in
  31114 - the
  31115 - case
  31116 - of
  31117 - the
  31118 - Denizens
  31119 - who
  31120 - got
  31121 - trodden
  31122 - on
  31123 - by
  31124 - the
  31125 - Not-Horses‘
  31126 - steel-clad
  31127 - toes
  31128 - We‘re
  31129 - away

  31131 - an
  31132 - artillerist
  31133 - in
  31134 - the
  31135 - crowd
  31136 - as
  31137 - the
  31138 - elevator
  31139 - began
  31140 - to
  31141 - accelerate
  31142 - upward
  31143 - She
  31144 - sounded
  31145 - relieved
  31146 - and
  31147 - there
  31148 - was
  31149 - a
  31150 - general
  31151 - lessening
  31152 - of
  31153 - tension
  31154 - among
  31155 - all
  31156 - the
  31157 - Denizens
  31158 - and
  31159 - a
  31160 - sudden
  31161 - rise
  31162 - in
  31163 - the
  31164 - volume
  31165 - and
  31166 - extent
  31167 - of
  31168 - conversation
  31169 - Unlike
  31170 - Suzy‘s
  31171 - elevator
  31172 - descent
  31173 - from
  31174 - the
  31175 - Upper
  31176 - House
  31177 - the
  31178 - ascent
  31179 - to
  31180 - the
  31181 - Middle
  31182 - House
  31183 - was
  31184 - quite
  31185 - a
  31186 - steady
  31187 - and
  31188 - civilised
  31189 - journey
  31190 - It
  31191 - was
  31192 - much
  31193 - slower
  31194 - taking
  31195 - several
  31196 - hours
  31197 - but
  31198 - there
  31199 - were
  31200 - raisin-
  31201 - filled
  31202 - biscuits
  31203 - and
  31204 - though
  31205 - the
  31206 - bandstand
  31207 - was
  31208 - empty
  31209 - to
  31210 - begin
  31211 - with
  31212 - various
  31213 - soldiers
  31214 - produced
  31215 - instruments
  31216 - and
  31217 - soon
  31218 - there
  31219 - was
  31220 - a
  31221 - scratch
  31222 - quartet
  31223 - of
  31224 - musicians
  31225 - playing
  31226 - typically
  31227 - soothing
  31228 - elevator
  31229 - music
  31230 - not
  31231 - very
  31232 - well
  31233 - Suzy
  31234 - in
  31235 - her
  31236 - usual
  31237 - fashion
  31238 - did
  31239 - not
  31240 - dwell
  31241 - on
  31242 - the
  31243 - bad
  31244 - news
  31245 - or
  31246 - think
  31247 - much
  31248 - about
  31249 - what
  31250 - lay
  31251 - ahead
  31252 - Instead
  31253 - she
  31254 - set
  31255 - her
  31256 - Piper‘s
  31257 - children
  31258 - to
  31259 - looking
  31260 - around
  31261 - the
  31262 - transported
  31263 - stores
  31264 - to
  31265 - see
  31266 - if
  31267 - there
  31268 - was
  31269 - anything
  31270 - that
  31271 - they
  31272 - might
  31273 - want
  31274 - to
  31275 - borrow
  31276 - as
  31277 - she
  31278 - put
  31279 - it
  31280 - But
  31281 - there
  31282 - was
  31283 - nothing
  31284 - of
  31285 - any
  31286 - great
  31287 - interest
  31288 - to
  31289 - Suzy
  31290 - though
  31291 - she
  31292 - did
  31293 - procure
  31294 - a
  31295 - savage-sword
  31296 - for
  31297 - herself
  31298 - and
  31299 - got
  31300 - Giac
  31301 - a
  31302 - brassbound
  31303 - shooting
  31304 - stick
  31305 - that
  31306 - he
  31307 - said
  31308 - would
  31309 - be
  31310 - a
  31311 - fine
  31312 - replacement
  31313 - for
  31314 - his
  31315 - umbrella
  31316 - He
  31317 - even
  31318 - thought
  31319 - it
  31320 - would
  31321 - be
  31322 - easier
  31323 - to
  31324 - cast
  31325 - spells
  31326 - with
  31327 - it
  31328 - and
  31329 - in
  31330 - his
  31331 - newfound
  31332 - confidence
  31333 - was
  31334 - going
  31335 - to
  31336 - give
  31337 - it
  31338 - a
  31339 - try
  31340 - before
  31341 - Part
  31342 - Six
  31343 - of
  31344 - the
  31345 - Will
  31346 - dissuaded
  31347 - him
  31348 - Their
  31349 - arrival
  31350 - was
  31351 - also
  31352 - smooth
  31353 - with
  31354 - hardly
  31355 - a
  31356 - bump
  31357 - and
  31358 - the
  31359 - merest
  31360 - chime
  31361 - to
  31362 - announce
  31363 - the
  31364 - fact
  31365 - The
  31366 - doors
  31367 - slid
  31368 - open
  31369 - and
  31370 - at
  31371 - once
  31372 - Marshal
  31373 - Dusk
  31374 - strode
  31375 - out
  31376 - with
  31377 - Suzy
  31378 - the
  31379 - raven
  31380 - Giac
  31381 - and
  31382 - the
  31383 - Piper‘s
  31384 - children
  31385 - close
  31386 - behind
  31387 - Suzy
  31388 - recognized
  31389 - the
  31390 - courtyard
  31391 - the
  31392 - elevator
  31393 - had
  31394 - appeared
  31395 - in
  31396 - It
  31397 - was
  31398 - the
  31399 - central
  31400 - bailey
  31401 - in
  31402 - front
  31403 - of
  31404 - the
  31405 - main
  31406 - keep
  31407 - of
  31408 - Binding
  31409 - Junction
  31410 - the
  31411 - fortress
  31412 - on

  31416 - of
  31417 - the
  31418 - Middle
  31419 - House
  31420 - Suzy
  31421 - shielded
  31422 - her
  31423 - eyes
  31424 - with
  31425 - her
  31426 - hand
  31427 - as
  31428 - she
  31429 - looked
  31430 - around
  31431 - It
  31432 - was
  31433 - very
  31434 - hot
  31435 - and
  31436 - bright
  31437 - on
  31438 - the
  31439 - Top
  31440 - Shelf
  31441 - a
  31442 - consequence
  31443 - of
  31444 - there
  31445 - being
  31446 - two
  31447 - suns
  31448 - in
  31449 - the
  31450 - sky
  31451 - above
  31452 - one
  31453 - smaller
  31454 - than

  31457 - The
  31458 - courtyard
  31459 - had
  31460 - been
  31461 - empty
  31462 - when
  31463 - Suzy
  31464 - had
  31465 - last
  31466 - passed
  31467 - through
  31468 - but
  31469 - now
  31470 - it
  31471 - was
  31472 - full
  31473 - of
  31474 - Army
  31475 - wagons
  31476 - all
  31477 - carefully
  31478 - lined
  31479 - up
  31480 - against
  31481 - the
  31482 - walls
  31483 - The
  31484 - curious
  31485 - scaly-leaved
  31486 - trees
  31487 - were
  31488 - gone
  31489 - not
  31490 - even
  31491 - their
  31492 - stumps
  31493 - visible
  31494 - Soldiers
  31495 - were
  31496 - everywhere
  31497 - moving
  31498 - about
  31499 - purposefully
  31500 - either
  31501 - because
  31502 - they
  31503 - genuinely
  31504 - had
  31505 - work
  31506 - to
  31507 - do
  31508 - or
  31509 - wanted
  31510 - to
  31511 - appear
  31512 - as
  31513 - if
  31514 - they
  31515 - did
  31516 - There
  31517 - were
  31518 - a
  31519 - few
  31520 - High
  31521 - Guild
  31522 - Bookbinders
  31523 - wandering
  31524 - about
  31525 - as
  31526 - well
  31527 - in
  31528 - their
  31529 - velvet
  31530 - robes
  31531 - carrying
  31532 - papers
  31533 - and
  31534 - pots
  31535 - of
  31536 - glue
  31537 - or

  31539 - long
  31540 - needle-like
  31541 - spears

  31543 - Dusk
  31544 - was
  31545 - met
  31546 - by
  31547 - several
  31548 - officers
  31549 - After
  31550 - speaking
  31551 - briefly
  31552 - to
  31553 - them
  31554 - he
  31555 - beckoned
  31556 - to
  31557 - Suzy
  31558 - Dame
  31559 - Primus
  31560 - wishes
  31561 - to

  31579 - Guess
  31580 - you‘d
  31581 - better
  31582 - come
  31583 - too—
  31584 - Suzy
  31585 - began
  31586 - to
  31587 - say
  31588 - to
  31589 - Part
  31590 - Six
  31591 - of
  31592 - the
  31593 - Will
  31594 - but
  31595 - it
  31596 - was
  31597 - already
  31598 - in
  31599 - flight
  31600 - flapping
  31601 - up
  31602 - to
  31603 - the
  31604 - top
  31605 - of
  31606 - the

  31617 - Suzy
  31618 - recognised
  31619 - the
  31620 - very
  31621 - tall
  31622 - and
  31623 - formidable
  31624 - figure
  31625 - who
  31626 - was
  31627 - looking
  31628 - down
  31629 - straight
  31630 - at
  31631 - her
  31632 - Dame
  31633 - Primus
  31634 - raised
  31635 - her
  31636 - arm
  31637 - as
  31638 - the
  31639 - raven
  31640 - alighted
  31641 - on
  31642 - her
  31643 - hand
  31644 - There
  31645 - was
  31646 - a
  31647 - flash
  31648 - of
  31649 - light
  31650 - a
  31651 - disturbing
  31652 - sound
  31653 - like
  31654 - the
  31655 - hum
  31656 - of
  31657 - a
  31658 - giant
  31659 - cymbal
  31660 - lightly
  31661 - struck
  31662 - and
  31663 - the
  31664 - raven
  31665 - disappeared
  31666 - Pity
  31667 - muttered
  31668 - Suzy
  31669 - It
  31670 - was
  31671 - the
  31672 - best
  31673 - part

  31675 - far
  31676 - if
  31677 - you

  31679 - me
  31680 - ‘Ope

  31698 - said
  31699 - Suzy
  31700 - Just
  31701 - thinking
  31702 - aloud
  31703 - Guess
  31704 - we‘d
  31705 - better
  31706 - go
  31707 - up
  31708 - Don‘t
  31709 - s‘pose
  31710 - you‘ve
  31711 - got
  31712 - a
  31713 - decent
  31714 - pair
  31715 - of
  31716 - spare
  31717 - wings

  31719 - a
  31720 - couple
  31721 - of
  31722 - pairs
  31723 - I‘ve
  31724 - only
  31725 - got
  31726 - some
  31727 - mangy
  31728 - grease
  31729 - monkey
  31730 - pinions
  31731 - and
  31732 - I
  31733 - don‘t
  31734 - trust

  31737 - Wings
  31738 - are

  31754 - will
  31755 - need
  31756 - every

  31777 - Fair
  31778 - enough

  31782 - looked
  31783 - back
  31784 - at
  31785 - Athan
  31786 - winked
  31787 - and
  31788 - touched
  31789 - the
  31790 - side
  31791 - of
  31792 - her
  31793 - nose
  31794 - The
  31795 - Piper‘s
  31796 - child

  31803 - melted
  31804 - back

  31830 - She
  31831 - started
  31832 - off
  31833 - at
  31834 - a
  31835 - run
  31836 - but
  31837 - paused

  31866 - a
  31867 - joke

  31869 - started
  31870 - to
  31871 - explain
  31872 - Oh
  31873 - never

  31875 - I‘m

  31907 - Well

  31911 - It‘s
  31912 - a

  31919 - She
  31920 - stopped

  31923 - took
  31924 - Giac
  31925 - by

  31959 - smiles
  31960 - passed

  32131 - the

  32140 - large
  32141 - and
  32142 - uglylooking
  32143 - pendant

  32198 - of

  32201 - particularly
  32202 - when
  32203 - others

  32207 - thought

  32240 - approached
  32241 - a

  32245 - armor
  32246 - slicing
  32247 - off

  32250 - of

  33154 - Her
  33155 - long
  33156 - elegant
  33157 - fingers
  33158 - snapped
  33159 - with
  33160 - a
  33161 - crack
  33162 - that
  33163 - was
  33164 - as
  33165 - loud
  33166 - as
  33167 - a
  33168 - small
  33169 - cannon
  33170 - and
  33171 - several
  33172 - Denizens

  33194 - Dame

  33226 - dangling
  33227 - from
  33228 - her
  33229 - limp
  33230 - fingers
  33231 - She
  33232 - had
  33233 - been
  33234 - fighting
  33235 - almost
  33236 - nonstop
  33237 - for
  33238 - what
  33239 - felt
  33240 - like
  33241 - hours
  33242 - though
  33243 - she
  33244 - had
  33245 - no
  33246 - means
  33247 - of
  33248 - measuring
  33249 - time
  33250 - so
  33251 - perhaps
  33252 - it
  33253 - was
  33254 - only
  33255 - feverish
  33256 - adrenaline-fuelled
  33257 - minutes
  33258 - Her
  33259 - Nithling
  33260 - opponents
  33261 - lay
  33262 - dead
  33263 - slowly
  33264 - drifting
  33265 - away
  33266 - from
  33267 - her
  33268 - propelled
  33269 - by
  33270 - their
  33271 - final
  33272 - actions
  33273 - or
  33274 - by
  33275 - the
  33276 - cuts
  33277 - and
  33278 - thrusts
  33279 - of
  33280 - the
  33281 - sword
  33282 - that
  33283 - had
  33284 - danced
  33285 - in
  33286 - her
  33287 - hand
  33288 - as
  33289 - if
  33290 - it
  33291 - had
  33292 - a
  33293 - life
  33294 - of
  33295 - its
  33296 - own
  33297 - Perhaps
  33298 - it
  33299 - does
  33300 - have
  33301 - a
  33302 - life
  33303 - of
  33304 - its
  33305 - own
  33306 - thought
  33307 - Leaf
  33308 - with
  33309 - distaste
  33310 - After
  33311 - dispatching
  33312 - the
  33313 - first
  33314 - wave
  33315 - of
  33316 - Nithlings
  33317 - –
  33318 - a
  33319 - dozen
  33320 - slow-moving
  33321 - things
  33322 - that
  33323 - looked
  33324 - more
  33325 - like
  33326 - human-size
  33327 - turnips
  33328 - than
  33329 - anything
  33330 - else
  33331 - though
  33332 - they
  33333 - had
  33334 - mouths
  33335 - with
  33336 - needle-sharp
  33337 - fangs
  33338 - –
  33339 - she
  33340 - had
  33341 - tried
  33342 - to
  33343 - drop
  33344 - the
  33345 - sword
  33346 - and
  33347 - run
  33348 - to
  33349 - the
  33350 - exit
  33351 - she
  33352 - knew
  33353 - led
  33354 - to
  33355 - her
  33356 - Earth
  33357 - But
  33358 - try
  33359 - as
  33360 - she
  33361 - might
  33362 - she
  33363 - could
  33364 - not
  33365 - lose
  33366 - the
  33367 - sword
  33368 - If
  33369 - she
  33370 - let
  33371 - go
  33372 - the
  33373 - goldbraided
  33374 - strap
  33375 - tightened
  33376 - on
  33377 - her
  33378 - wrist
  33379 - so
  33380 - she
  33381 - could
  33382 - not
  33383 - slip
  33384 - it
  33385 - off
  33386 - and
  33387 - if
  33388 - she
  33389 - slipped
  33390 - the
  33391 - strap
  33392 - off
  33393 - first
  33394 - her
  33395 - fingers
  33396 - became
  33397 - glued
  33398 - to
  33399 - the
  33400 - hilt
  33401 - Before
  33402 - she
  33403 - had
  33404 - been
  33405 - able
  33406 - to
  33407 - experiment
  33408 - further
  33409 - another
  33410 - Nithling
  33411 - had
  33412 - attacked
  33413 - It
  33414 - was
  33415 - alone
  33416 - but
  33417 - far
  33418 - more
  33419 - trouble
  33420 - than
  33421 - the
  33422 - previous
  33423 - lot
  33424 - It
  33425 - was
  33426 - rather
  33427 - like
  33428 - a
  33429 - bear
  33430 - with
  33431 - the
  33432 - horns
  33433 - of
  33434 - a
  33435 - bull
  33436 - and
  33437 - it
  33438 - was
  33439 - fast
  33440 - and
  33441 - clever
  33442 - It
  33443 - had
  33444 - scratched
  33445 - Leaf
  33446 - and
  33447 - would
  33448 - have
  33449 - taken
  33450 - her
  33451 - head
  33452 - off
  33453 - if
  33454 - she
  33455 - had
  33456 - jumped
  33457 - back
  33458 - any
  33459 - slower
  33460 - Years
  33461 - of
  33462 - gymnastics
  33463 - when
  33464 - she
  33465 - was
  33466 - younger
  33467 - had
  33468 - finally
  33469 - paid
  33470 - off
  33471 - Leaf
  33472 - inspected
  33473 - the
  33474 - scratch
  33475 - The
  33476 - blue
  33477 - swallow-tailed
  33478 - coat
  33479 - looked
  33480 - like
  33481 - it
  33482 - was
  33483 - made
  33484 - of
  33485 - wool
  33486 - but
  33487 - was
  33488 - evidently
  33489 - made
  33490 - of
  33491 - much
  33492 - tougher
  33493 - stuff
  33494 - The
  33495 - Nithling‘s
  33496 - horn
  33497 - had
  33498 - not
  33499 - even
  33500 - torn
  33501 - the
  33502 - cloth
  33503 - as
  33504 - it
  33505 - had
  33506 - scraped
  33507 - across
  33508 - but
  33509 - the
  33510 - very
  33511 - tip
  33512 - had
  33513 - drawn
  33514 - blood
  33515 - from
  33516 - her
  33517 - unprotected
  33518 - throat
  33519 - Leaf
  33520 - looked
  33521 - at
  33522 - the
  33523 - blood
  33524 - It
  33525 - was
  33526 - hard
  33527 - to
  33528 - tell
  33529 - since
  33530 - the
  33531 - only
  33532 - light
  33533 - came
  33534 - from
  33535 - the
  33536 - blue
  33537 - radiance
  33538 - of
  33539 - the
  33540 - sword
  33541 - but
  33542 - she
  33543 - was
  33544 - relieved
  33545 - to
  33546 - see
  33547 - it
  33548 - still
  33549 - looked
  33550 - red
  33551 - and
  33552 - human
  33553 - From
  33554 - what
  33555 - had
  33556 - happened
  33557 - to
  33558 - Arthur
  33559 - Leaf
  33560 - was
  33561 - well
  33562 - aware
  33563 - of
  33564 - the
  33565 - contamination
  33566 - caused
  33567 - by
  33568 - House
  33569 - sorcery
  33570 - and
  33571 - its
  33572 - transformative
  33573 - effects
  33574 - Which
  33575 - means
  33576 - I
  33577 - have
  33578 - to
  33579 - ditch
  33580 - this
  33581 - sword
  33582 - soon
  33583 - she
  33584 - thought
  33585 - And
  33586 - get
  33587 - back
  33588 - home
  33589 - There
  33590 - were
  33591 - lots
  33592 - more
  33593 - Nithlings
  33594 - inside
  33595 - the
  33596 - Front
  33597 - Door
  33598 - Leaf
  33599 - could
  33600 - sense
  33601 - everything
  33602 - in
  33603 - the
  33604 - Door
  33605 - in
  33606 - a
  33607 - general
  33608 - kind
  33609 - of
  33610 - way
  33611 - including
  33612 - intruders
  33613 - entrances
  33614 - and
  33615 - exits
  33616 - and
  33617 - if
  33618 - she
  33619 - concentrated
  33620 - on
  33621 - any
  33622 - particular
  33623 - aspect
  33624 - she
  33625 - could
  33626 - work
  33627 - out
  33628 - more
  33629 - Right
  33630 - now
  33631 - there
  33632 - was
  33633 - only
  33634 - one
  33635 - group
  33636 - of
  33637 - Nithlings
  33638 - headed
  33639 - in
  33640 - her
  33641 - direction
  33642 - Leaf
  33643 - decided
  33644 - not
  33645 - to
  33646 - wait
  33647 - for
  33648 - their
  33649 - arrival
  33650 - but
  33651 - to
  33652 - check
  33653 - out
  33654 - the
  33655 - entrance
  33656 - she‘d
  33657 - come
  33658 - in
  33659 - by
  33660 - the
  33661 - one
  33662 - she
  33663 - knew
  33664 - led
  33665 - to
  33666 - Earth
  33667 - There
  33668 - was
  33669 - something
  33670 - different
  33671 - about
  33672 - that
  33673 - one
  33674 - –
  33675 - it
  33676 - made
  33677 - a
  33678 - different
  33679 - sensation
  33680 - in
  33681 - her
  33682 - head
  33683 - when
  33684 - she
  33685 - thought
  33686 - about
  33687 - it
  33688 - but
  33689 - she
  33690 - didn‘t
  33691 - know
  33692 - what
  33693 - that
  33694 - meant
  33695 - Apart
  33696 - from
  33697 - essentially
  33698 - fighting
  33699 - on
  33700 - its
  33701 - own
  33702 - the
  33703 - Lieutenant
  33704 - Keeper‘s
  33705 - sword
  33706 - was
  33707 - also
  33708 - useful
  33709 - in
  33710 - other
  33711 - ways
  33712 - Leaf
  33713 - found
  33714 - When
  33715 - she
  33716 - lifted
  33717 - it
  33718 - and
  33719 - thought
  33720 - of
  33721 - heading
  33722 - towards
  33723 - the
  33724 - exit
  33725 - to
  33726 - Earth
  33727 - it
  33728 - immediately
  33729 - oriented
  33730 - towards
  33731 - that
  33732 - point
  33733 - and
  33734 - began
  33735 - to
  33736 - pull
  33737 - Leaf
  33738 - along
  33739 - It
  33740 - did
  33741 - so
  33742 - gently
  33743 - at
  33744 - first
  33745 - but
  33746 - gradually
  33747 - accelerated
  33748 - until
  33749 - the
  33750 - girl
  33751 - had
  33752 - to
  33753 - hold
  33754 - on
  33755 - with
  33756 - both
  33757 - hands
  33758 - Doesn‘t
  33759 - mean
  33760 - I‘m
  33761 - going
  33762 - to
  33763 - keep
  33764 - you
  33765 - said
  33766 - Leaf
  33767 - She
  33768 - was
  33769 - thinking
  33770 - about
  33771 - how
  33772 - she
  33773 - might
  33774 - rid
  33775 - herself
  33776 - of
  33777 - the
  33778 - weapon
  33779 - and
  33780 - the
  33781 - unwanted
  33782 - post
  33783 - of
  33784 - being
  33785 - Lieutenant
  33786 - Keeper
  33787 - If
  33788 - she
  33789 - could
  33790 - work
  33791 - out
  33792 - how
  33793 - to
  33794 - let
  33795 - go
  33796 - of
  33797 - the
  33798 - sword
  33799 - she
  33800 - could
  33801 - just
  33802 - leave
  33803 - it
  33804 - behind
  33805 - Or
  33806 - it
  33807 - might
  33808 - be
  33809 - as
  33810 - easy
  33811 - as
  33812 - finding
  33813 - someone
  33814 - to
  33815 - give
  33816 - the
  33817 - weapon
  33818 - to
  33819 - just
  33820 - as
  33821 - she
  33822 - had
  33823 - received
  33824 - it
  33825 - from
  33826 - the
  33827 - previous
  33828 - wielder
  33829 - Of
  33830 - course
  33831 - she
  33832 - might
  33833 - need
  33834 - to
  33835 - be
  33836 - dying
  33837 - before
  33838 - she
  33839 - could
  33840 - give
  33841 - it
  33842 - up
  33843 - which
  33844 - was
  33845 - a
  33846 - depressing
  33847 - thought
  33848 - Leaf
  33849 - supposed
  33850 - she
  33851 - also
  33852 - ought
  33853 - to
  33854 - think
  33855 - very
  33856 - carefully
  33857 - about
  33858 - who
  33859 - ended
  33860 - up
  33861 - as
  33862 - Lieutenant
  33863 - Keeper
  33864 - Not
  33865 - that
  33866 - the
  33867 - job
  33868 - was
  33869 - as
  33870 - important
  33871 - as
  33872 - it
  33873 - once
  33874 - was
  33875 - considering
  33876 - that
  33877 - large
  33878 - parts
  33879 - of
  33880 - the
  33881 - House
  33882 - weren‘t
  33883 - there
  33884 - anymore
  33885 - Leaf
  33886 - felt
  33887 - the
  33888 - dead
  33889 - ends
  33890 - like
  33891 - a
  33892 - toothache
  33893 - and
  33894 - immediately
  33895 - turned
  33896 - her
  33897 - mind
  33898 - away
  33899 - from
  33900 - thinking
  33901 - about
  33902 - them
  33903 - There
  33904 - was
  33905 - nothing
  33906 - she
  33907 - could
  33908 - do
  33909 - about
  33910 - that
  33911 - anyway
  33912 - and
  33913 - with
  33914 - any
  33915 - luck
  33916 - she‘d
  33917 - soon
  33918 - be
  33919 - home
  33920 - and
  33921 - could
  33922 - hope
  33923 - everything
  33924 - would
  33925 - go
  33926 - back
  33927 - to
  33928 - normal
  33929 - As
  33930 - if
  33931 - that‘s
  33932 - going
  33933 - to
  33934 - happen
  33935 - thought
  33936 - Leaf
  33937 - but
  33938 - she
  33939 - repressed
  33940 - that
  33941 - thought
  33942 - too
  33943 - and
  33944 - returned
  33945 - to
  33946 - working
  33947 - out
  33948 - methods
  33949 - of
  33950 - losing
  33951 - the
  33952 - sword
  33953 - and
  33954 - the
  33955 - office
  33956 - that
  33957 - went
  33958 - with
  33959 - it
  33960 - Getting
  33961 - Arthur‘s
  33962 - help
  33963 - or
  33964 - the
  33965 - assistance
  33966 - of
  33967 - Dr
  33968 - Scamandros
  33969 - would
  33970 - be
  33971 - the
  33972 - best
  33973 - bet
  33974 - If
  33975 - she
  33976 - went
  33977 - to
  33978 - one
  33979 - of
  33980 - the
  33981 - exits
  33982 - into
  33983 - the
  33984 - Great
  33985 - Maze…
  33986 - Leaf‘s
  33987 - train
  33988 - of
  33989 - thought
  33990 - derailed
  33991 - as
  33992 - she
  33993 - focused
  33994 - on
  33995 - the
  33996 - portals
  33997 - to
  33998 - the
  33999 - Great
  34000 - Maze
  34001 - and
  34002 - discovered
  34003 - that
  34004 - there
  34005 - no
  34006 - longer
  34007 - were
  34008 - any
  34009 - though
  34010 - she
  34011 - was
  34012 - sure
  34013 - she‘d
  34014 - felt
  34015 - some
  34016 - only
  34017 - minutes
  34018 - before
  34019 - It‘s
  34020 - getting
  34021 - worse
  34022 - Leaf
  34023 - said
  34024 - aloud
  34025 - She
  34026 - was
  34027 - torn
  34028 - by
  34029 - indecision
  34030 - unsure
  34031 - whether
  34032 - she
  34033 - should
  34034 - try
  34035 - to
  34036 - help
  34037 - in
  34038 - some
  34039 - way
  34040 - or
  34041 - just
  34042 - get
  34043 - out
  34044 - If
  34045 - she
  34046 - could
  34047 - The
  34048 - just-getting-out
  34049 - part
  34050 - of
  34051 - her
  34052 - mind
  34053 - won
  34054 - for
  34055 - the
  34056 - moment
  34057 - though
  34058 - she
  34059 - rationalized
  34060 - it
  34061 - as
  34062 - merely
  34063 - an
  34064 - attempt
  34065 - She
  34066 - would
  34067 - try
  34068 - to
  34069 - ditch
  34070 - the
  34071 - sword
  34072 - and
  34073 - go
  34074 - home
  34075 - If
  34076 - that
  34077 - didn‘t
  34078 - work
  34079 - she‘d
  34080 - go
  34081 - and
  34082 - find
  34083 - Arthur
  34084 - and
  34085 - Dr
  34086 - Scamandros
  34087 - and
  34088 - the
  34089 - others…somewhere…the
  34090 - Middle
  34091 - House
  34092 - perhaps
  34093 - since
  34094 - she
  34095 - could
  34096 - still
  34097 - feel
  34098 - exits
  34099 - there
  34100 - Soon
  34101 - after
  34102 - she
  34103 - reached
  34104 - the
  34105 - exit
  34106 - to
  34107 - her
  34108 - world
  34109 - It
  34110 - appeared
  34111 - as
  34112 - a
  34113 - normal-size
  34114 - doorway
  34115 - of
  34116 - pure
  34117 - white
  34118 - light
  34119 - that
  34120 - was
  34121 - always
  34122 - vertical
  34123 - whichever
  34124 - way
  34125 - Leaf
  34126 - approached
  34127 - it
  34128 - rotating
  34129 - as
  34130 - she
  34131 - rotated
  34132 - even
  34133 - corkscrewing
  34134 - around
  34135 - to
  34136 - match
  34137 - her
  34138 - movement
  34139 - which
  34140 - she
  34141 - did
  34142 - just
  34143 - to
  34144 - see
  34145 - what
  34146 - it
  34147 - would
  34148 - do
  34149 - When
  34150 - she
  34151 - stopped
  34152 - up
  34153 - close
  34154 - to
  34155 - the
  34156 - shining
  34157 - portal
  34158 - Leaf
  34159 - found
  34160 - she
  34161 - could
  34162 - see
  34163 - through
  34164 - it
  34165 - out
  34166 - to
  34167 - the
  34168 - world
  34169 - beyond
  34170 - She
  34171 - also
  34172 - sensed
  34173 - that
  34174 - the
  34175 - exit
  34176 - had
  34177 - a
  34178 - sort
  34179 - of
  34180 - frayed
  34181 - or
  34182 - fraying
  34183 - feel
  34184 - about
  34185 - it
  34186 - as
  34187 - if
  34188 - it
  34189 - would
  34190 - soon
  34191 - collapse
  34192 - The
  34193 - Reaper
  34194 - must
  34195 - have
  34196 - made
  34197 - it
  34198 - she
  34199 - surmised
  34200 - so
  34201 - it
  34202 - was
  34203 - only
  34204 - temporary
  34205 - The
  34206 - exit
  34207 - was
  34208 - still
  34209 - located
  34210 - in
  34211 - the
  34212 - same
  34213 - space
  34214 - as
  34215 - the
  34216 - front
  34217 - door
  34218 - of
  34219 - Friday‘s
  34220 - hospital
  34221 - Leaf
  34222 - was
  34223 - momentarily
  34224 - puzzled
  34225 - when
  34226 - she
  34227 - looked
  34228 - outside
  34229 - because
  34230 - everything
  34231 - looked
  34232 - almost
  34233 - exactly
  34234 - the
  34235 - same
  34236 - as
  34237 - when
  34238 - she‘d
  34239 - left
  34240 - The
  34241 - personnel
  34242 - carrier
  34243 - was
  34244 - there
  34245 - smoke
  34246 - still
  34247 - trickling
  34248 - from
  34249 - the
  34250 - barrel
  34251 - of
  34252 - its
  34253 - machine
  34254 - gun
  34255 - The
  34256 - front
  34257 - of
  34258 - it
  34259 - was
  34260 - bashed
  34261 - up
  34262 - and
  34263 - dented
  34264 - the
  34265 - rear
  34266 - door
  34267 - was
  34268 - lying
  34269 - about
  34270 - twenty
  34271 - feet
  34272 - away
  34273 - and
  34274 - she
  34275 - could
  34276 - see
  34277 - a
  34278 - masked
  34279 - and
  34280 - suited
  34281 - figure
  34282 - peeking
  34283 - cautiously
  34284 - around
  34285 - the
  34286 - right-
  34287 - hand
  34288 - track
  34289 - The
  34290 - caution
  34291 - was
  34292 - because
  34293 - the
  34294 - Reaper‘s
  34295 - creature
  34296 - –
  34297 - the
  34298 - beastwort
  34299 - –
  34300 - was
  34301 - also
  34302 - still
  34303 - there
  34304 - Leaf
  34305 - had
  34306 - thought
  34307 - it
  34308 - would
  34309 - disappear
  34310 - with
  34311 - its
  34312 - master
  34313 - but
  34314 - he‘d
  34315 - just
  34316 - abandoned
  34317 - it
  34318 - The
  34319 - huge
  34320 - tentacled
  34321 - thing
  34322 - was
  34323 - gently
  34324 - swaying
  34325 - on
  34326 - its
  34327 - many
  34328 - legs
  34329 - right
  34330 - in
  34331 - front
  34332 - of
  34333 - the
  34334 - doors
  34335 - Though
  34336 - Leaf
  34337 - had
  34338 - been
  34339 - gone
  34340 - for
  34341 - what
  34342 - seemed
  34343 - like
  34344 - hours
  34345 - it
  34346 - appeared
  34347 - only
  34348 - a
  34349 - very
  34350 - few
  34351 - minutes
  34352 - had
  34353 - passed
  34354 - on
  34355 - Earth
  34356 - She
  34357 - looked
  34358 - at
  34359 - the
  34360 - beastwort
  34361 - its
  34362 - curious
  34363 - daisy-like
  34364 - head
  34365 - of
  34366 - questing
  34367 - tendrils
  34368 - and
  34369 - its
  34370 - very
  34371 - long
  34372 - and
  34373 - immensely
  34374 - strong
  34375 - tentacles
  34376 - There
  34377 - was
  34378 - little
  34379 - chance
  34380 - of
  34381 - sprinting
  34382 - past
  34383 - it
  34384 - and
  34385 - even
  34386 - with
  34387 - the
  34388 - Lieutenant
  34389 - Keeper‘s
  34390 - sword
  34391 - she
  34392 - didn‘t
  34393 - fancy
  34394 - her
  34395 - chances
  34396 - fighting
  34397 - it
  34398 - In
  34399 - any
  34400 - case
  34401 - Leaf
  34402 - knew
  34403 - she
  34404 - shouldn‘t
  34405 - take
  34406 - the
  34407 - sword
  34408 - out
  34409 - of
  34410 - the
  34411 - Door
  34412 - and
  34413 - definitely
  34414 - not
  34415 - to
  34416 - Earth
  34417 - It
  34418 - would
  34419 - create
  34420 - plagues
  34421 - and
  34422 - trouble
  34423 - as
  34424 - all
  34425 - powers
  34426 - of
  34427 - the
  34428 - House
  34429 - did
  34430 - when
  34431 - brought
  34432 - to
  34433 - the
  34434 - Secondary
  34435 - Realms
  34436 - OK
  34437 - you
  34438 - have
  34439 - to
  34440 - go
  34441 - Leaf
  34442 - said
  34443 - to
  34444 - the
  34445 - weapon
  34446 - She
  34447 - unhooked
  34448 - the
  34449 - loop
  34450 - and
  34451 - tried
  34452 - to
  34453 - pry
  34454 - her
  34455 - fingers
  34456 - off
  34457 - the
  34458 - hilt
  34459 - with
  34460 - her
  34461 - left
  34462 - hand
  34463 - But
  34464 - once
  34465 - again
  34466 - she
  34467 - simply
  34468 - could
  34469 - not
  34470 - open
  34471 - her
  34472 - grip
  34473 - Leaf
  34474 - grimaced
  34475 - and
  34476 - put
  34477 - the
  34478 - loop
  34479 - back
  34480 - over
  34481 - her
  34482 - wrist
  34483 - Then
  34484 - she
  34485 - let
  34486 - go
  34487 - the
  34488 - sword
  34489 - dangling
  34490 - from
  34491 - the
  34492 - golden
  34493 - cord
  34494 - Leaf
  34495 - let
  34496 - it
  34497 - hang
  34498 - for
  34499 - a
  34500 - moment
  34501 - then
  34502 - swiftly
  34503 - pulled
  34504 - her
  34505 - hand
  34506 - back
  34507 - to
  34508 - try
  34509 - to
  34510 - get
  34511 - it
  34512 - free
  34513 - of
  34514 - the
  34515 - loop
  34516 - in
  34517 - one
  34518 - motion
  34519 - It
  34520 - didn‘t
  34521 - work
  34522 - Leaf
  34523 - tried
  34524 - to
  34525 - throw
  34526 - the
  34527 - sword
  34528 - overhand
  34529 - and
  34530 - slip
  34531 - her
  34532 - hand
  34533 - away
  34534 - as
  34535 - the
  34536 - blade
  34537 - arced
  34538 - overhead
  34539 - but
  34540 - all
  34541 - that
  34542 - did
  34543 - was
  34544 - nearly
  34545 - slice
  34546 - her
  34547 - own
  34548 - kneecap
  34549 - off
  34550 - She
  34551 - bit
  34552 - her
  34553 - knuckles
  34554 - in
  34555 - the
  34556 - hope
  34557 - that
  34558 - pain
  34559 - might
  34560 - help
  34561 - her
  34562 - move
  34563 - her
  34564 - fingers
  34565 - That
  34566 - didn‘t
  34567 - work
  34568 - either
  34569 - Next
  34570 - she
  34571 - held
  34572 - the
  34573 - hilt
  34574 - with
  34575 - her
  34576 - left
  34577 - hand
  34578 - and
  34579 - slipped
  34580 - her
  34581 - right
  34582 - hand
  34583 - out
  34584 - of
  34585 - the
  34586 - loop
  34587 - and
  34588 - was
  34589 - momentarily
  34590 - triumphant
  34591 - –
  34592 - till
  34593 - she
  34594 - couldn‘t
  34595 - let
  34596 - go
  34597 - with
  34598 - her
  34599 - left
  34600 - hand
  34601 - and
  34602 - ended
  34603 - up
  34604 - having
  34605 - to
  34606 - transfer
  34607 - the
  34608 - sword
  34609 - back
  34610 - to
  34611 - her
  34612 - right
  34613 - hand
  34614 - again
  34615 - out
  34616 - of
  34617 - nervousness
  34618 - that
  34619 - she
  34620 - might
  34621 - be
  34622 - attacked
  34623 - for
  34624 - she
  34625 - sensed
  34626 - Nithlings
  34627 - getting
  34628 - closer
  34629 - Finally
  34630 - she
  34631 - gave
  34632 - in
  34633 - All
  34634 - right
  34635 - I‘ll
  34636 - just
  34637 - have
  34638 - to
  34639 - get
  34640 - help
  34641 - ”
  34642 - she
  34643 - said
  34644 - There
  34645 - was
  34646 - an
  34647 - exit
  34648 - to
  34649 - the
  34650 - Middle
  34651 - House
  34652 - not
  34653 - too
  34654 - far
  34655 - away
  34656 - but
  34657 - before
  34658 - Leaf
  34659 - headed
  34660 - towards
  34661 - it
  34662 - she
  34663 - took
  34664 - another
  34665 - wistful
  34666 - look
  34667 - at
  34668 - her
  34669 - own
  34670 - world
  34671 - Nothing
  34672 - had
  34673 - changed
  34674 - She
  34675 - could
  34676 - see
  34677 - movement
  34678 - and
  34679 - it
  34680 - was
  34681 - not
  34682 - in
  34683 - super
  34684 - slow
  34685 - motion
  34686 - but
  34687 - evidently
  34688 - when
  34689 - she
  34690 - wasn‘t
  34691 - looking
  34692 - time
  34693 - moved
  34694 - much
  34695 - more
  34696 - slowly
  34697 - out
  34698 - on
  34699 - Earth
  34700 - The
  34701 - soldier
  34702 - at
  34703 - the
  34704 - back
  34705 - of
  34706 - the
  34707 - carrier
  34708 - moved
  34709 - out
  34710 - a
  34711 - few
  34712 - paces
  34713 - while
  34714 - Leaf
  34715 - watched
  34716 - She
  34717 - couldn‘t
  34718 - tell
  34719 - who
  34720 - it
  34721 - was
  34722 - but
  34723 - thought
  34724 - from
  34725 - the
  34726 - size
  34727 - it
  34728 - was
  34729 - Major
  34730 - Penhaligon
  34731 - He
  34732 - moved
  34733 - very
  34734 - carefully
  34735 - and
  34736 - kept
  34737 - his
  34738 - focus
  34739 - on
  34740 - the
  34741 - beastwort
  34742 - It
  34743 - was
  34744 - observing
  34745 - him
  34746 - too
  34747 - for
  34748 - several
  34749 - of
  34750 - its
  34751 - petal-like
  34752 - sensory
  34753 - organs
  34754 - aligned
  34755 - themselves
  34756 - in
  34757 - his
  34758 - direction
  34759 - The
  34760 - soldier
  34761 - took
  34762 - another
  34763 - step
  34764 - and
  34765 - a
  34766 - tentacle
  34767 - suddenly
  34768 - lashed
  34769 - out
  34770 - and
  34771 - knocked
  34772 - him
  34773 - down
  34774 - He
  34775 - rolled
  34776 - away
  34777 - and
  34778 - another
  34779 - soldier
  34780 - dragged
  34781 - him
  34782 - back
  34783 - into
  34784 - the
  34785 - carrier
  34786 - as
  34787 - the
  34788 - tentacle
  34789 - struck
  34790 - the
  34791 - ground
  34792 - where
  34793 - he‘d
  34794 - been
  34795 - a
  34796 - moment
  34797 - before
  34798 - It‘s
  34799 - got
  34800 - them
  34801 - penned
  34802 - in
  34803 - Leaf
  34804 - realized
  34805 - But
  34806 - it‘s
  34807 - not
  34808 - going
  34809 - over
  34810 - to
  34811 - get
  34812 - them
  34813 - It‘s
  34814 - guarding
  34815 - the
  34816 - Door
  34817 - I
  34818 - suppose
  34819 - –
  34820 - but
  34821 - that
  34822 - means
  34823 - no
  34824 - one
  34825 - can
  34826 - get
  34827 - in
  34828 - to
  34829 - help
  34830 - Aunt
  34831 - Mango
  34832 - and
  34833 - the
  34834 - sleepers
  34835 - I
  34836 - have
  34837 - to
  34838 - do
  34839 - something
  34840 - Leaf
  34841 - looked
  34842 - at
  34843 - the
  34844 - sword
  34845 - Maybe
  34846 - if
  34847 - I
  34848 - just
  34849 - run
  34850 - out
  34851 - and
  34852 - stab
  34853 - that
  34854 - flower
  34855 - thing
  34856 - it
  34857 - has
  34858 - for
  34859 - a
  34860 - head
  34861 - that‘ll
  34862 - kill
  34863 - it
  34864 - But
  34865 - to
  34866 - do
  34867 - that
  34868 - I‘d
  34869 - have
  34870 - to
  34871 - jump
  34872 - on
  34873 - its
  34874 - back
  34875 - Leaf
  34876 - looked
  34877 - again
  34878 - The
  34879 - beastwort
  34880 - was
  34881 - the
  34882 - size
  34883 - of
  34884 - a
  34885 - small
  34886 - haystack
  34887 - But
  34888 - most
  34889 - of
  34890 - its
  34891 - sensory
  34892 - petals
  34893 - were
  34894 - angled
  34895 - in
  34896 - front
  34897 - of
  34898 - it
  34899 - and
  34900 - Leaf
  34901 - thought
  34902 - that
  34903 - if
  34904 - she
  34905 - jumped
  34906 - up
  34907 - to
  34908 - the
  34909 - handrail
  34910 - of
  34911 - the
  34912 - wheelchair
  34913 - ramp
  34914 - and
  34915 - took
  34916 - off
  34917 - from
  34918 - there
  34919 - she
  34920 - could
  34921 - land
  34922 - on
  34923 - its
  34924 - back
  34925 - Suzy
  34926 - could
  34927 - do
  34928 - this
  34929 - she
  34930 - thought
  34931 - her
  34932 - mouth
  34933 - strangely
  34934 - dry
  34935 - Arthur
  34936 - could
  34937 - do
  34938 - it
  34939 - Maybe
  34940 - I
  34941 - can
  34942 - I
  34943 - kicked
  34944 - Feverfew‘s
  34945 - head
  34946 - pretty
  34947 - well
  34948 - didn‘t
  34949 - I
  34950 - Albert
  34951 - would
  34952 - tell
  34953 - me
  34954 - I
  34955 - could
  34956 - do
  34957 - it
  34958 - –
  34959 - Straight
  34960 - up
  34961 - the
  34962 - ratlines
  34963 - to
  34964 - the
  34965 - mast
  34966 - he
  34967 - always
  34968 - said
  34969 - Don‘t
  34970 - look
  34971 - down…
  34972 - Leaf
  34973 - wiped
  34974 - her
  34975 - eyes
  34976 - hefted
  34977 - her
  34978 - sword
  34979 - and
  34980 - took
  34981 - a
  34982 - deep
  34983 - breath
  34984 - Go
  34985 - ”
  34986 - she
  34987 - shouted
  34988 - to
  34989 - encourage
  34990 - herself
  34991 - as
  34992 - she
  34993 - leaped
  34994 - out
  34995 - of
  34996 - the
  34997 - Door
  34998 - Or
  34999 - at
  35000 - least
  35001 - she
  35002 - tried
  35003 - to
  35004 - The
  35005 - sword
  35006 - hit
  35007 - the
  35008 - brilliant
  35009 - white
  35010 - rectangle
  35011 - of
  35012 - the
  35013 - exit
  35014 - and
  35015 - bounced
  35016 - off
  35017 - but
  35018 - the
  35019 - momentum
  35020 - of
  35021 - her
  35022 - jump
  35023 - carried
  35024 - the
  35025 - rest
  35026 - of
  35027 - Leaf
  35028 - on
  35029 - Her
  35030 - arm
  35031 - twisted
  35032 - round
  35033 - horribly
  35034 - as
  35035 - she
  35036 - found
  35037 - herself
  35038 - falling
  35039 - down
  35040 - the
  35041 - wheelchair
  35042 - ramp
  35043 - Her
  35044 - right
  35045 - hand
  35046 - and
  35047 - the
  35048 - sword
  35049 - remained
  35050 - inside
  35051 - the
  35052 - Front
  35053 - Door
  35054 - while
  35055 - the
  35056 - rest
  35057 - of
  35058 - her
  35059 - sprawled
  35060 - across
  35061 - the
  35062 - ramp
  35063 - Leaf
  35064 - groaned
  35065 - and
  35066 - tried
  35067 - to
  35068 - pull
  35069 - the
  35070 - sword
  35071 - through
  35072 - But
  35073 - it
  35074 - wouldn‘t
  35075 - come
  35076 - out
  35077 - She
  35078 - was
  35079 - anchored
  35080 - to
  35081 - the
  35082 - Door
  35083 - She
  35084 - looked
  35085 - up
  35086 - The
  35087 - yellow
  35088 - petals
  35089 - of
  35090 - the
  35091 - beastwort‘s
  35092 - head
  35093 - were
  35094 - tilting
  35095 - towards
  35096 - her
  35097 - Two
  35098 - tentacles
  35099 - as
  35100 - thick
  35101 - as
  35102 - her
  35103 - arm
  35104 - were
  35105 - rising
  35106 - in
  35107 - the
  35108 - air
  35109 - as
  35110 - the
  35111 - creature
  35112 - swiveled
  35113 - round
  35114 - on
  35115 - its
  35116 - many
  35117 - many
  35118 - legs
  35119 - Leaf
  35120 - concentrated
  35121 - all
  35122 - her
  35123 - willpower
  35124 - and
  35125 - pulled
  35126 - the
  35127 - sword
  35128 - halfway
  35129 - out
  35130 - through
  35131 - the
  35132 - glass
  35133 - door
  35134 - of
  35135 - the
  35136 - hospital
  35137 - Come
  35138 - on
  35139 - ”
  35140 - she
  35141 - shouted
  35142 - but
  35143 - she
  35144 - couldn‘t
  35145 - get
  35146 - the
  35147 - sword
  35148 - to
  35149 - budge
  35150 - the
  35151 - last
  35152 - four
  35153 - inches
  35154 - firmly
  35155 - stuck
  35156 - in
  35157 - the
  35158 - Door
  35159 - So
  35160 - she
  35161 - pushed
  35162 - it
  35163 - back
  35164 - and
  35165 - tried
  35166 - to
  35167 - follow
  35168 - it
  35169 - inside
  35170 - only
  35171 - to
  35172 - be
  35173 - stopped
  35174 - by
  35175 - a
  35176 - tentacle
  35177 - gripping
  35178 - her
  35179 - around
  35180 - the
  35181 - ankles
  35182 - and
  35183 - dragging
  35184 - her
  35185 - back
  35186 - No
  35187 - ”
  35188 - screamed
  35189 - Leaf
  35190 - The
  35191 - beastwort
  35192 - was
  35193 - going
  35194 - to
  35195 - tear
  35196 - her
  35197 - apart
  35198 - with
  35199 - her
  35200 - arm
  35201 - stuck
  35202 - in
  35203 - the
  35204 - Door
  35205 - Desperately
  35206 - she
  35207 - looked
  35208 - around
  35209 - for
  35210 - some
  35211 - other
  35212 - weapon
  35213 - her
  35214 - left
  35215 - hand
  35216 - scrabbling
  35217 - about
  35218 - searching
  35219 - in
  35220 - panic
  35221 - for
  35222 - anything
  35223 - that
  35224 - she
  35225 - could
  35226 - use
  35227 - as
  35228 - the
  35229 - first
  35230 - tentacle
  35231 - lifted
  35232 - her
  35233 - higher
  35234 - and
  35235 - the
  35236 - second
  35237 - tentacle
  35238 - whipped
  35239 - in
  35240 - and
  35241 - fastened
  35242 - itself
  35243 - around
  35244 - her
  35245 - middle
  35246 - almost
  35247 - capturing
  35248 - her
  35249 - free
  35250 - arm
  35251 - Leaf
  35252 - knew
  35253 - that
  35254 - this
  35255 - was
  35256 - it
  35257 - –
  35258 - she
  35259 - was
  35260 - going
  35261 - to
  35262 - be
  35263 - killed
  35264 - by
  35265 - a
  35266 - plant
  35267 - Then
  35268 - her
  35269 - fingers
  35270 - found
  35271 - something
  35272 - –
  35273 - a
  35274 - rope
  35275 - or
  35276 - cord
  35277 - –
  35278 - and
  35279 - she
  35280 - grabbed
  35281 - it
  35282 - and
  35283 - tried
  35284 - to
  35285 - haul
  35286 - herself
  35287 - back
  35288 - towards
  35289 - the
  35290 - Door
  35291 - with
  35292 - it
  35293 - but
  35294 - instead
  35295 - she
  35296 - went
  35297 - towards
  35298 - the
  35299 - body
  35300 - of
  35301 - the
  35302 - beastwort
  35303 - Amid
  35304 - her
  35305 - panic
  35306 - a
  35307 - sharp
  35308 - thought
  35309 - blossomed
  35310 - in
  35311 - Leaf‘s
  35312 - mind
  35313 - I‘ve
  35314 - got
  35315 - the
  35316 - thing‘s
  35317 - lead
  35318 - CHAPTER
  35319 - FOURTEEN
  35320 - Arthur
  35321 - waited
  35322 - anxiously
  35323 - for
  35324 - Elephant‘s
  35325 - return
  35326 - The
  35327 - steady
  35328 - tick
  35329 - of
  35330 - the
  35331 - clock
  35332 - did
  35333 - nothing
  35334 - to
  35335 - help
  35336 - his
  35337 - nervousness
  35338 - which
  35339 - increased
  35340 - as
  35341 - the
  35342 - time
  35343 - dragged
  35344 - on
  35345 - and
  35346 - his
  35347 - childhood
  35348 - friend
  35349 - did
  35350 - not
  35351 - come
  35352 - back
  35353 - An
  35354 - hour
  35355 - passed
  35356 - then
  35357 - two
  35358 - and
  35359 - as
  35360 - the
  35361 - hour
  35362 - hand
  35363 - moved
  35364 - to
  35365 - the
  35366 - three
  35367 - Arthur
  35368 - found
  35369 - his
  35370 - chains
  35371 - long
  35372 - enough
  35373 - for
  35374 - him
  35375 - to
  35376 - step
  35377 - a
  35378 - short
  35379 - distance
  35380 - away
  35381 - from
  35382 - the
  35383 - clock
  35384 - face
  35385 - At
  35386 - six
  35387 - he
  35388 - guessed
  35389 - they
  35390 - might
  35391 - be
  35392 - long
  35393 - enough
  35394 - for
  35395 - him
  35396 - to
  35397 - reach
  35398 - the
  35399 - edge
  35400 - of
  35401 - the
  35402 - terrace
  35403 - and
  35404 - look
  35405 - down
  35406 - He
  35407 - tried
  35408 - not
  35409 - to
  35410 - think
  35411 - of
  35412 - what
  35413 - he
  35414 - might
  35415 - see
  35416 - but
  35417 - he
  35418 - couldn‘t
  35419 - help
  35420 - visualizing
  35421 - many
  35422 - images
  35423 - of
  35424 - his
  35425 - Elephant
  35426 - dead
  35427 - or
  35428 - captured
  35429 - In
  35430 - any
  35431 - case
  35432 - that
  35433 - was
  35434 - three
  35435 - hours
  35436 - away
  35437 - Three
  35438 - more
  35439 - hours
  35440 - of
  35441 - waiting
  35442 - I
  35443 - need
  35444 - to
  35445 - think
  35446 - of
  35447 - another
  35448 - plan
  35449 - Arthur
  35450 - told
  35451 - himself
  35452 - But
  35453 - try
  35454 - as
  35455 - he
  35456 - might
  35457 - he
  35458 - couldn‘t
  35459 - and
  35460 - he
  35461 - found
  35462 - himself
  35463 - thinking
  35464 - again
  35465 - about
  35466 - Lord
  35467 - Sunday‘s
  35468 - offer
  35469 - That
  35470 - made
  35471 - him
  35472 - remember
  35473 - A
  35474 - Complete
  35475 - Atlas
  35476 - of
  35477 - the
  35478 - House
  35479 - It
  35480 - had
  35481 - been
  35482 - blocked
  35483 - before
  35484 - but
  35485 - there
  35486 - was
  35487 - always
  35488 - a
  35489 - slim
  35490 - chance…
  35491 - Arthur
  35492 - took
  35493 - it
  35494 - out
  35495 - from
  35496 - inside
  35497 - his
  35498 - coveralls
  35499 - The
  35500 - book
  35501 - had
  35502 - fallen
  35503 - down
  35504 - to
  35505 - his
  35506 - waistband
  35507 - and
  35508 - it
  35509 - was
  35510 - quite
  35511 - difficult
  35512 - to
  35513 - get
  35514 - it
  35515 - out
  35516 - his
  35517 - manacled
  35518 - wrists
  35519 - clashing
  35520 - as
  35521 - he
  35522 - did
  35523 - so
  35524 - He
  35525 - sat
  35526 - on
  35527 - the
  35528 - edge
  35529 - of
  35530 - the
  35531 - clock
  35532 - and
  35533 - rested
  35534 - the
  35535 - Atlas
  35536 - on
  35537 - his
  35538 - knees
  35539 - As
  35540 - before
  35541 - it
  35542 - opened
  35543 - and
  35544 - slowly
  35545 - grew
  35546 - to
  35547 - its
  35548 - full
  35549 - size
  35550 - Tell
  35551 - me
  35552 - how
  35553 - I
  35554 - can
  35555 - get
  35556 - these
  35557 - manacles
  35558 - off
  35559 - said
  35560 - Arthur
  35561 - He
  35562 - thought
  35563 - for
  35564 - a
  35565 - second
  35566 - and
  35567 - added
  35568 - Or
  35569 - undo
  35570 - the
  35571 - chains
  35572 - from
  35573 - the
  35574 - clock
  35575 - ”
  35576 - A
  35577 - blob
  35578 - of
  35579 - ink
  35580 - appeared
  35581 - giving
  35582 - Arthur
  35583 - a
  35584 - moment‘s
  35585 - hope
  35586 - that
  35587 - the
  35588 - Atlas
  35589 - was
  35590 - going
  35591 - to
  35592 - write
  35593 - something
  35594 - But
  35595 - it
  35596 - didn‘t
  35597 - The
  35598 - blob
  35599 - spread
  35600 - and
  35601 - several
  35602 - more
  35603 - blotches
  35604 - materialized
  35605 - none
  35606 - of
  35607 - them
  35608 - looking
  35609 - anything
  35610 - like
  35611 - a
  35612 - letter
  35613 - Arthur
  35614 - watched
  35615 - them
  35616 - for
  35617 - a
  35618 - few
  35619 - seconds
  35620 - in
  35621 - case
  35622 - they
  35623 - formed
  35624 - a
  35625 - pattern
  35626 - or
  35627 - a
  35628 - sketch
  35629 - or
  35630 - something
  35631 - that
  35632 - would
  35633 - help
  35634 - him
  35635 - but
  35636 - they
  35637 - remained
  35638 - mere
  35639 - ink
  35640 - stains
  35641 - devoid
  35642 - of
  35643 - meaning
  35644 - He
  35645 - was
  35646 - about
  35647 - to
  35648 - ask
  35649 - another
  35650 - question
  35651 - when
  35652 - he
  35653 - caught
  35654 - a
  35655 - faint
  35656 - sound
  35657 - on
  35658 - the
  35659 - wind
  35660 - –
  35661 - a
  35662 - kind
  35663 - of
  35664 - whirring
  35665 - noise
  35666 - that
  35667 - he
  35668 - instantly
  35669 - recognized
  35670 - as
  35671 - one
  35672 - of
  35673 - Sunday‘s
  35674 - dragonflies
  35675 - Quickly
  35676 - Arthur
  35677 - shut
  35678 - the
  35679 - Atlas
  35680 - and
  35681 - as
  35682 - it
  35683 - shrank
  35684 - he
  35685 - stuffed
  35686 - it
  35687 - back
  35688 - down
  35689 - his
  35690 - front
  35691 - Looking
  35692 - up
  35693 - he
  35694 - saw
  35695 - a
  35696 - dragonfly
  35697 - commence
  35698 - its
  35699 - approach
  35700 - to
  35701 - once
  35702 - again
  35703 - end
  35704 - up
  35705 - hovering
  35706 - nearby
  35707 - A
  35708 - rope
  35709 - ladder
  35710 - came
  35711 - clattering
  35712 - down
  35713 - and
  35714 - Lord
  35715 - Sunday
  35716 - descended
  35717 - The
  35718 - Trustee
  35719 - was
  35720 - alone
  35721 - this
  35722 - time
  35723 - He
  35724 - looked
  35725 - around
  35726 - satisfied
  35727 - himself
  35728 - that
  35729 - all
  35730 - was
  35731 - secure
  35732 - then
  35733 - approached
  35734 - Arthur
  35735 - making
  35736 - sure
  35737 - not
  35738 - to
  35739 - stand
  35740 - too
  35741 - close
  35742 - to
  35743 - the
  35744 - clock
  35745 - Even
  35746 - from
  35747 - several
  35748 - paces
  35749 - away
  35750 - and
  35751 - without
  35752 - Lord
  35753 - Sunday
  35754 - having
  35755 - to
  35756 - hold
  35757 - his
  35758 - Key
  35759 - Arthur
  35760 - could
  35761 - feel
  35762 - the
  35763 - power
  35764 - of
  35765 - it
  35766 - pushing
  35767 - him
  35768 - down
  35769 - making
  35770 - him
  35771 - feel
  35772 - like
  35773 - a
  35774 - servant
  35775 - or
  35776 - a
  35777 - beggar
  35778 - or
  35779 - maybe
  35780 - since
  35781 - they
  35782 - were
  35783 - in
  35784 - the
  35785 - Incomparable
  35786 - Gardens
  35787 - some
  35788 - small
  35789 - worm
  35790 - to
  35791 - be
  35792 - stepped
  35793 - on
  35794 - and
  35795 - forgotten

  35797 - you
  35798 - reconsidered

  35800 - asked
  35801 - Lord
  35802 - Sunday
  35803 - I‘m
  35804 - thinking
  35805 - about
  35806 - it
  35807 - Arthur
  35808 - answered
  35809 - honestly
  35810 - Can
  35811 - I
  35812 - ask
  35813 - you
  35814 - some
  35815 - questions
  35816 - ”
  35817 - You
  35818 - may
  35819 - have
  35820 - fifteen
  35821 - minutes

  35823 - Lord
  35824 - Sunday
  35825 - He
  35826 - looked
  35827 - at
  35828 - the
  35829 - clock
  35830 - There
  35831 - are
  35832 - currently
  35833 - many
  35834 - matters
  35835 - that
  35836 - require
  35837 - my
  35838 - attention
  35839 - and
  35840 - I
  35841 - do
  35842 - not

  35849 - Why
  35850 - didn‘t
  35851 - you
  35852 - fulfil
  35853 - your
  35854 - duty
  35855 - as
  35856 - a
  35857 - Trustee
  35858 - ”
  35859 - asked
  35860 - Arthur
  35861 - Why
  35862 - break
  35863 - up
  35864 - and
  35865 - hide
  35866 - the
  35867 - Will
  35868 - ”
  35869 - So
  35870 - you
  35871 - do
  35872 - not
  35873 - know
  35874 - even
  35875 - that
  35876 - said
  35877 - Lord
  35878 - Sunday
  35879 - I
  35880 - am
  35881 - surprised
  35882 - someone
  35883 - so
  35884 - ignorant
  35885 - has
  35886 - come
  35887 - so
  35888 - far
  35889 - ”
  35890 - Arthur
  35891 - shrugged
  35892 - That‘s
  35893 - not
  35894 - an
  35895 - answer
  35896 - ”
  35897 - It
  35898 - is
  35899 - a
  35900 - matter
  35901 - of

  35903 - will
  35904 - inherit

  35906 - Architect‘s
  35907 - powers

  35940 - I‘d
  35941 - just
  35942 - been

  36036 - Lady
  36037 - Friday
  36038 - have
  36039 - also
  36040 - been
  36041 - slain
  36042 - The
  36043 - Will
  36044 - is
  36045 - an
  36046 - instrument
  36047 - of
  36048 - the
  36049 - Architect
  36050 - with
  36051 - a
  36052 - single
  36053 - aim
  36054 - The
  36055 - Trustees
  36056 - in
  36057 - its
  36058 - view

  36060 - traitors
  36061 - and

  36063 - be
  36064 - punished

  36066 - I
  36067 - thought…I
  36068 - thought
  36069 - it
  36070 - was
  36071 - probably
  36072 - Superior
  36073 - Saturday…or
  36074 - you
  36075 - said
  36076 - Arthur
  36077 - But
  36078 - he
  36079 - did
  36080 - not
  36081 - protest
  36082 - more
  36083 - violently
  36084 - because
  36085 - what
  36086 - Lord
  36087 - Sunday
  36088 - was
  36089 - saying
  36090 - sounded
  36091 - like
  36092 - the
  36093 - truth
  36094 - and
  36095 - Arthur
  36096 - knew
  36097 - in
  36098 - his
  36099 - heart
  36100 - that
  36101 - murder
  36102 - was
  36103 - something
  36104 - that
  36105 - the
  36106 - Will
  36107 - was
  36108 - perfectly
  36109 - capable
  36110 - of
  36111 - doing
  36112 - I
  36113 - have
  36114 - tried
  36115 - to
  36116 - simply
  36117 - tend
  36118 - my
  36119 - garden
  36120 - said
  36121 - Lord
  36122 - Sunday
  36123 - That
  36124 - is
  36125 - all
  36126 - I
  36127 - have
  36128 - ever
  36129 - wanted
  36130 - That
  36131 - is
  36132 - why
  36133 - I
  36134 - did
  36135 - not
  36136 - follow
  36137 - the
  36138 - Architect‘s
  36139 - instructions
  36140 - and
  36141 - why
  36142 - I
  36143 - allowed
  36144 - the
  36145 - Will
  36146 - to
  36147 - be
  36148 - broken

  36150 - But
  36151 - you‘re
  36152 - the
  36153 - Architect‘s
  36154 - son
  36155 - ”
  36156 - Yes
  36157 - replied
  36158 - Lord
  36159 - Sunday
  36160 - but
  36161 - not
  36162 - as
  36163 - a
  36164 - mortal
  36165 - would
  36166 - understand
  36167 - it
  36168 - It
  36169 - is
  36170 - true

  36172 - am
  36173 - an
  36174 - offshoot
  36175 - of
  36176 - both
  36177 - the
  36178 - Architect
  36179 - and
  36180 - the
  36181 - Old
  36182 - One
  36183 - In
  36184 - any
  36185 - case
  36186 - a
  36187 - very
  36188 - very
  36189 - long
  36190 - time
  36191 - ago
  36192 - we…disagreed
  36193 - culminating
  36194 - in
  36195 - the
  36196 - Architect‘s
  36197 - imprisonment
  36198 - of
  36199 - the
  36200 - Old
  36201 - One
  36202 - The
  36203 - Piper
  36204 - sulked
  36205 - in
  36206 - some
  36207 - hidden
  36208 - fastness
  36209 - and
  36210 - the
  36211 - Mariner
  36212 - embarked
  36213 - on
  36214 - his
  36215 - journeying
  36216 - I
  36217 - remained
  36218 - in
  36219 - my
  36220 - garden
  36221 - The
  36222 - Architect
  36223 - herself
  36224 - withdrew
  36225 - completely
  36226 - and
  36227 - nothing
  36228 - was
  36229 - heard
  36230 - from
  36231 - her
  36232 - for
  36233 - a
  36234 - period
  36235 - of
  36236 - time
  36237 - you
  36238 - cannot
  36239 - even
  36240 - imagine
  36241 - Then
  36242 - completely
  36243 - unexpectedly
  36244 - there
  36245 - came
  36246 - the
  36247 - Will

  36249 - What
  36250 - happened
  36251 - to
  36252 - the

  36259 - she
  36260 - dead

  36262 - No
  36263 - ”
  36264 - A
  36265 - grim
  36266 - smile
  36267 - briefly
  36268 - curled
  36269 - across
  36270 - Lord
  36271 - Sunday‘s
  36272 - mouth
  36273 - so
  36274 - swiftly
  36275 - Arthur
  36276 - wasn‘t
  36277 - even
  36278 - sure
  36279 - he‘d
  36280 - seen
  36281 - it
  36282 - Not
  36283 - yet

  36285 - So
  36286 - she‘s
  36287 - missing
  36288 - or
  36289 - has
  36290 - done
  36291 - that
  36292 - thing
  36293 - when
  36294 - kings
  36295 - resign

  36297 - Abdicate

  36299 - Lord
  36300 - Sunday
  36301 - Yes
  36302 - She
  36303 - has
  36304 - abdicated
  36305 - and
  36306 - that

  36320 - be
  36321 - the
  36322 - Rightful

  36331 - the
  36332 - Will‘s
  36333 - purpose
  36334 - Many
  36335 - would
  36336 - have
  36337 - done
  36338 - better

  36342 - So
  36343 - why
  36344 - don‘t
  36345 - you
  36346 - just
  36347 - give
  36348 - me
  36349 - your
  36350 - Key
  36351 - and
  36352 - I‘ll
  36353 - let
  36354 - you
  36355 - keep
  36356 - looking
  36357 - after
  36358 - the
  36359 - Incomparable
  36360 - Gardens
  36361 - Though
  36362 - you‘d
  36363 - have
  36364 - to
  36365 - help
  36366 - me

  36382 - you
  36383 - take
  36384 - the
  36385 - Key

  36398 - I…
  36399 - Arthur
  36400 - stopped

  36402 - didn‘t
  36403 - know
  36404 - what
  36405 - to

  36423 - do

  36425 - she
  36426 - was
  36427 - told

  36655 - said
  36656 - that

  36833 - time
  36834 - thinking
  36835 - many
  36836 - of

  36855 - This
  36856 - time
  36857 - Lord
  36858 - Sunday
  36859 - did
  36860 - not
  36861 - ascend
  36862 - the
  36863 - ladder
  36864 - to
  36865 - the
  36866 - hovering

  36869 - climbed
  36870 - the
  36871 - hill
  36872 - disappearing
  36873 - over
  36874 - the
  36875 - edge
  36876 - of
  36877 - the
  36878 - next
  36879 - terrace
  36880 - above
  36881 - Arthur
  36882 - watched
  36883 - him
  36884 - go
  36885 - then
  36886 - looked
  36887 - up
  36888 - at
  36889 - the
  36890 - dragonfly
  36891 - He
  36892 - couldn‘t
  36893 - see
  36894 - Sunday‘s
  36895 - Dawn
  36896 - or
  36897 - Noon
  36898 - but
  36899 - there
  36900 - were
  36901 - Denizens
  36902 - aboard
  36903 - who
  36904 - were
  36905 - looking
  36906 - over
  36907 - the

  36909 - monitoring
  36910 - him

  36924 - and
  36925 - violet
  36926 - flowers
  36927 - Arthur
  36928 - couldn‘t

  36931 - he‘d
  36932 - found
  36933 - the
  36934 - medal

  36944 - later
  36945 - Lord
  36946 - Sunday
  36947 - came
  36948 - back
  36949 - down
  36950 - the
  36951 - hill
  36952 - He
  36953 - stopped
  36954 - by
  36955 - the
  36956 - clock
  36957 - and
  36958 - looked
  36959 - at
  36960 - Arthur
  36961 - who
  36962 - shook
  36963 - his
  36964 - head
  36965 - Even
  36966 - that
  36967 - movement
  36968 - felt
  36969 - difficult
  36970 - and
  36971 - a
  36972 - strong
  36973 - desire
  36974 - to
  36975 - agree
  36976 - with
  36977 - Lord
  36978 - Sunday
  36979 - washed
  36980 - over
  36981 - him
  36982 - followed
  36983 - by
  36984 - a
  36985 - flash
  36986 - of
  36987 - fear
  36988 - He‘s
  36989 - using
  36990 - the
  36991 - Seventh
  36992 - Key‘s
  36993 - power
  36994 - on

  37006 - believe
  37007 - what
  37008 - he
  37009 - tells
  37010 - me
  37011 - But
  37012 - it
  37013 - might
  37014 - be
  37015 - true
  37016 - Maybe
  37017 - I
  37018 - shouldn‘t
  37019 - be
  37020 - trying
  37021 - to
  37022 - free
  37023 - the
  37024 - Will
  37025 - after
  37026 - all
  37027 - Maybe
  37028 - it‘s
  37029 - all
  37030 - been
  37031 - a
  37032 - mistake
  37033 - Maybe
  37034 - I
  37035 - should
  37036 - just
  37037 - give
  37038 - the
  37039 - Keys
  37040 - up…
  37041 - A
  37042 - clanking
  37043 - noise
  37044 - interrupted
  37045 - his
  37046 - thoughts
  37047 - Arthur
  37048 - found
  37049 - his

  37060 - remove
  37061 - the
  37062 - Atlas
  37063 - Angrily
  37064 - he
  37065 - pushed
  37066 - it
  37067 - back
  37068 - down
  37069 - and
  37070 - took
  37071 - his

  37113 - mind

  37143 - heard

  37152 - its
  37153 - swift
  37154 - passage
  37155 - till
  37156 - it

  37242 - drew
  37243 - Elephant
  37244 - under

  37504 - me
  37505 - she
  37506 - answered
  37507 - weakly
  37508 - Are
  37509 - you
  37510 - OK
  37511 - I‘ve
  37512 - got
  37513 - a
  37514 - flame-throwing
  37515 - tank
  37516 - en
  37517 - route
  37518 - but
  37519 - it‘s
  37520 - still
  37521 - an
  37522 - hour
  37523 - away
  37524 - and
  37525 - we
  37526 - couldn‘t—
  37527 - No
  37528 - I…I
  37529 - think
  37530 - I‘m
  37531 - all
  37532 - right
  37533 - ”
  37534 - Leaf
  37535 - slowly
  37536 - stood
  37537 - up
  37538 - and
  37539 - tried
  37540 - to
  37541 - work
  37542 - out
  37543 - a
  37544 - position
  37545 - where
  37546 - she
  37547 - didn‘t
  37548 - feel
  37549 - so
  37550 - stupid
  37551 - with
  37552 - a
  37553 - sword
  37554 - stuck
  37555 - in
  37556 - one
  37557 - hand
  37558 - and
  37559 - a
  37560 - lead
  37561 - she
  37562 - couldn‘t
  37563 - let
  37564 - go
  37565 - of

  37567 - the
  37568 - other

  37570 - I‘m

  37577 - go

  37579 - through
  37580 - into…the…um…other
  37581 - dimension
  37582 - ”
  37583 - What
  37584 - ”
  37585 - asked
  37586 - Major
  37587 - Penhaligon
  37588 - Presumably
  37589 - they‘d
  37590 - seen
  37591 - her
  37592 - go
  37593 - through
  37594 - the
  37595 - hospital
  37596 - door
  37597 - with
  37598 - the
  37599 - Reaper
  37600 - not
  37601 - the
  37602 - House‘s
  37603 - Front
  37604 - Door
  37605 - because
  37606 - most
  37607 - mortals
  37608 - couldn‘t
  37609 - see
  37610 - it
  37611 - Though
  37612 - just
  37613 - going
  37614 - through
  37615 - the
  37616 - solid
  37617 - hospital
  37618 - door
  37619 - must
  37620 - have
  37621 - looked
  37622 - strange
  37623 - enough…
  37624 - It‘s
  37625 - kind
  37626 - of
  37627 - hard
  37628 - to
  37629 - explain
  37630 - said
  37631 - Leaf
  37632 - Weird
  37633 - stuff
  37634 - you
  37635 - know
  37636 - I
  37637 - mean
  37638 - really
  37639 - weird—
  37640 - The
  37641 - sword
  37642 - suddenly
  37643 - interrupted
  37644 - her
  37645 - dragging
  37646 - Leaf
  37647 - back
  37648 - till
  37649 - hilt
  37650 - and
  37651 - hand
  37652 - were
  37653 - inside
  37654 - the
  37655 - Front
  37656 - Door
  37657 - again
  37658 - She
  37659 - felt
  37660 - the
  37661 - weapon
  37662 - buck
  37663 - and
  37664 - move
  37665 - around
  37666 - It
  37667 - was
  37668 - fighting
  37669 - someone…or
  37670 - something…on
  37671 - the
  37672 - other
  37673 - side
  37674 - I
  37675 - have
  37676 - to

  37679 - said
  37680 - Leaf
  37681 - I‘ll
  37682 - take…Daisy…with

  37701 - shouted
  37702 - Major
  37703 - Penhaligon
  37704 - Wait
  37705 - ”
  37706 - His
  37707 - voice
  37708 - was
  37709 - cut
  37710 - off
  37711 - as
  37712 - Leaf
  37713 - went
  37714 - back
  37715 - through
  37716 - the
  37717 - Front
  37718 - Door
  37719 - She
  37720 - had
  37721 - braced
  37722 - herself
  37723 - to
  37724 - be
  37725 - ready
  37726 - to
  37727 - fight
  37728 - and
  37729 - expected
  37730 - the
  37731 - disorientation
  37732 - but
  37733 - even
  37734 - so
  37735 - she
  37736 - was
  37737 - surprised
  37738 - to
  37739 - find
  37740 - herself
  37741 - fighting
  37742 - a
  37743 - Nithling
  37744 - that
  37745 - was
  37746 - directly
  37747 - above
  37748 - her
  37749 - head
  37750 - and
  37751 - standing
  37752 - perpendicular
  37753 - to
  37754 - her
  37755 - This
  37756 - Nithling
  37757 - was
  37758 - humanoid
  37759 - looked
  37760 - like
  37761 - a
  37762 - badly
  37763 - smudged
  37764 - photocopy
  37765 - of
  37766 - an
  37767 - uglified
  37768 - Denizen
  37769 - and
  37770 - was
  37771 - wielding
  37772 - an
  37773 - oversize
  37774 - meat
  37775 - cleaver
  37776 - The
  37777 - Lieutenant
  37778 - Keeper‘s
  37779 - sword
  37780 - blocked
  37781 - a
  37782 - vicious
  37783 - chop
  37784 - but
  37785 - was
  37786 - borne
  37787 - back
  37788 - and
  37789 - Leaf
  37790 - felt
  37791 - the
  37792 - shock
  37793 - all
  37794 - the
  37795 - way
  37796 - from
  37797 - her
  37798 - wrist
  37799 - to
  37800 - her
  37801 - shoulder
  37802 - The
  37803 - sword
  37804 - tried
  37805 - to
  37806 - come
  37807 - up
  37808 - again
  37809 - but
  37810 - Leaf
  37811 - knew
  37812 - she
  37813 - was
  37814 - letting
  37815 - it
  37816 - down
  37817 - that
  37818 - her
  37819 - muscles
  37820 - and
  37821 - reflexes
  37822 - simply
  37823 - weren‘t
  37824 - good
  37825 - enough
  37826 - even
  37827 - with
  37828 - the
  37829 - sorcerous
  37830 - blade
  37831 - doing
  37832 - most
  37833 - of
  37834 - the
  37835 - work
  37836 - So
  37837 - she
  37838 - did
  37839 - a
  37840 - backflip
  37841 - and
  37842 - hauled
  37843 - hard
  37844 - on
  37845 - the
  37846 - beastwort‘s
  37847 - lead
  37848 - as
  37849 - the
  37850 - Nithling‘s
  37851 - chopper
  37852 - whisked
  37853 - past
  37854 - her
  37855 - heels
  37856 - Leaf
  37857 - stumbled
  37858 - as
  37859 - she
  37860 - landed
  37861 - because
  37862 - of
  37863 - the
  37864 - yielding
  37865 - nature
  37866 - of
  37867 - the
  37868 - Front
  37869 - Door‘s
  37870 - atmosphere
  37871 - and
  37872 - spun
  37873 - down
  37874 - again
  37875 - The
  37876 - Nithling
  37877 - gave
  37878 - out
  37879 - a
  37880 - grunting
  37881 - laugh
  37882 - and
  37883 - launched
  37884 - towards
  37885 - her
  37886 - raising
  37887 - its
  37888 - chopper
  37889 - Leaf
  37890 - lifted
  37891 - her
  37892 - sword
  37893 - to
  37894 - parry
  37895 - even
  37896 - though
  37897 - she
  37898 - knew
  37899 - it
  37900 - wouldn‘t
  37901 - work
  37902 - At
  37903 - the
  37904 - same
  37905 - time
  37906 - she
  37907 - cried
  37908 - out
  37909 - Daisy
  37910 - Help
  37911 - ”
  37912 - A
  37913 - tentacle
  37914 - lashed
  37915 - around
  37916 - the
  37917 - Nithling‘s
  37918 - wrist
  37919 - as
  37920 - the
  37921 - chopper
  37922 - fell
  37923 - and
  37924 - arrested
  37925 - its
  37926 - descent
  37927 - six
  37928 - inches
  37929 - away
  37930 - from
  37931 - Leaf‘s
  37932 - chest
  37933 - Another
  37934 - tentacle
  37935 - wrapped
  37936 - around
  37937 - the
  37938 - Nithling‘s
  37939 - neck
  37940 - and
  37941 - pulled
  37942 - its
  37943 - head
  37944 - off
  37945 - But
  37946 - this
  37947 - had
  37948 - little
  37949 - effect
  37950 - and
  37951 - Leaf
  37952 - shuddered
  37953 - as
  37954 - she
  37955 - saw
  37956 - that
  37957 - what
  37958 - she
  37959 - had
  37960 - thought
  37961 - were
  37962 - buttons
  37963 - on
  37964 - the
  37965 - thing‘s
  37966 - ragged
  37967 - coat

  37969 - in
  37970 - fact
  37971 - eyes
  37972 - and
  37973 - the
  37974 - coat
  37975 - its
  37976 - own
  37977 - hairy
  37978 - hide
  37979 - The
  37980 - head
  37981 - was
  37982 - just
  37983 - camouflage
  37984 - to
  37985 - make
  37986 - it
  37987 - look
  37988 - more
  37989 - like
  37990 - a
  37991 - Denizen
  37992 - Daisy
  37993 - was
  37994 - not
  37995 - discouraged
  37996 - by
  37997 - the
  37998 - Nithling‘s
  37999 - persistence
  38000 - Leaf
  38001 - looked
  38002 - away
  38003 - as
  38004 - the
  38005 - tentacles
  38006 - strong
  38007 - as
  38008 - a
  38009 - demolition
  38010 - machine
  38011 - ripped
  38012 - the
  38013 - Nithling
  38014 - apart
  38015 - and
  38016 - threw
  38017 - the
  38018 - pieces
  38019 - far
  38020 - away
  38021 - Somewhere
  38022 - in
  38023 - the
  38024 - recess
  38025 - of
  38026 - her
  38027 - mind
  38028 - she
  38029 - knew
  38030 - this
  38031 - was
  38032 - a
  38033 - tactical
  38034 - move
  38035 - because
  38036 - in
  38037 - the
  38038 - right
  38039 - circumstances
  38040 - such
  38041 - pieces
  38042 - could
  38043 - grow
  38044 - into
  38045 - small
  38046 - vicious
  38047 - Nithlings
  38048 - combine
  38049 - with
  38050 - other
  38051 - new-
  38052 - formed
  38053 - Nithlings
  38054 - or
  38055 - be
  38056 - transformed
  38057 - rather
  38058 - than
  38059 - destroyed
  38060 - if
  38061 - they
  38062 - met
  38063 - with
  38064 - patches
  38065 - of
  38066 - raw
  38067 - Nothing
  38068 - When
  38069 - it
  38070 - was
  38071 - quiet
  38072 - Leaf
  38073 - let
  38074 - the
  38075 - sword
  38076 - pull
  38077 - her
  38078 - up
  38079 - Well
  38080 - done
  38081 - Daisy
  38082 - she
  38083 - said
  38084 - Overcoming
  38085 - her
  38086 - repugnance
  38087 - she
  38088 - patted
  38089 - the
  38090 - thing‘s
  38091 - dimpled
  38092 - hide
  38093 - which
  38094 - felt
  38095 - like
  38096 - the
  38097 - rough
  38098 - skin
  38099 - of
  38100 - a
  38101 - pineapple
  38102 - Daisy
  38103 - let
  38104 - out
  38105 - a
  38106 - noise
  38107 - that
  38108 - could
  38109 - possibly
  38110 - be
  38111 - considered
  38112 - a
  38113 - purr
  38114 - though
  38115 - it
  38116 - sounded
  38117 - more
  38118 - like
  38119 - a
  38120 - drain
  38121 - being
  38122 - progressively
  38123 - unblocked
  38124 - Leaf
  38125 - wrapped
  38126 - her
  38127 - left
  38128 - hand
  38129 - around
  38130 - the
  38131 - lead
  38132 - a
  38133 - couple
  38134 - more
  38135 - times
  38136 - just
  38137 - to
  38138 - make
  38139 - sure
  38140 - she‘d
  38141 - keep
  38142 - control
  38143 - of
  38144 - the
  38145 - thing
  38146 - Then
  38147 - she
  38148 - shut
  38149 - her
  38150 - eyes
  38151 - and
  38152 - concentrated
  38153 - on
  38154 - what
  38155 - was
  38156 - going
  38157 - on
  38158 - inside
  38159 - the
  38160 - Front
  38161 - Door
  38162 - As
  38163 - before
  38164 - she
  38165 - could
  38166 - sense
  38167 - that
  38168 - there
  38169 - were
  38170 - groups
  38171 - of
  38172 - Nithlings
  38173 - and
  38174 - a
  38175 - few
  38176 - single
  38177 - monsters
  38178 - roaming
  38179 - around
  38180 - apparently
  38181 - aimlessly
  38182 - Leaf
  38183 - wondered
  38184 - if
  38185 - they
  38186 - were
  38187 - either
  38188 - unable
  38189 - to
  38190 - see
  38191 - the
  38192 - exits
  38193 - or
  38194 - prevented
  38195 - from
  38196 - going
  38197 - through
  38198 - them
  38199 - Possibly
  38200 - they
  38201 - were
  38202 - so
  38203 - newly
  38204 - formed
  38205 - from
  38206 - Nothing
  38207 - that
  38208 - they
  38209 - needed
  38210 - time
  38211 - for
  38212 - their
  38213 - brains
  38214 - to
  38215 - grow
  38216 - and
  38217 - become
  38218 - operational
  38219 - There
  38220 - were
  38221 - also
  38222 - large
  38223 - areas
  38224 - of
  38225 - Nothing
  38226 - within
  38227 - the
  38228 - Front
  38229 - Door
  38230 - As
  38231 - Leaf
  38232 - focused
  38233 - her
  38234 - new
  38235 - sense
  38236 - upon
  38237 - them
  38238 - she
  38239 - noted
  38240 - that
  38241 - the
  38242 - Nothing
  38243 - was
  38244 - slowly
  38245 - expanding
  38246 - spreading
  38247 - in
  38248 - several
  38249 - different
  38250 - directions
  38251 - and
  38252 - moving
  38253 - on
  38254 - several
  38255 - different
  38256 - planes
  38257 - It
  38258 - took
  38259 - her
  38260 - another
  38261 - moment
  38262 - to
  38263 - work
  38264 - out
  38265 - that
  38266 - this
  38267 - was
  38268 - because
  38269 - the
  38270 - Nothing
  38271 - was
  38272 - coming
  38273 - in
  38274 - through
  38275 - fifty
  38276 - or
  38277 - sixty
  38278 - different
  38279 - portals
  38280 - and
  38281 - that
  38282 - the
  38283 - interior
  38284 - of
  38285 - the
  38286 - Front
  38287 - Door
  38288 - was
  38289 - a
  38290 - hemisphere
  38291 - or
  38292 - dome
  38293 - several
  38294 - miles
  38295 - wide
  38296 - and
  38297 - high
  38298 - intersected
  38299 - on
  38300 - all
  38301 - sides
  38302 - by
  38303 - portals
  38304 - into
  38305 - the
  38306 - House
  38307 - and
  38308 - out
  38309 - to
  38310 - the
  38311 - Secondary
  38312 - Realms
  38313 - Some
  38314 - of
  38315 - the
  38316 - portals
  38317 - provided
  38318 - their
  38319 - own
  38320 - unique
  38321 - sensations
  38322 - when
  38323 - Leaf
  38324 - concentrated
  38325 - on
  38326 - them
  38327 - The
  38328 - ones
  38329 - for
  38330 - the
  38331 - Upper
  38332 - House
  38333 - gave
  38334 - her
  38335 - an
  38336 - unpleasant
  38337 - tingling
  38338 - sensation
  38339 - on
  38340 - the
  38341 - end
  38342 - of
  38343 - her
  38344 - tongue
  38345 - which
  38346 - she
  38347 - supposed
  38348 - meant
  38349 - they
  38350 - were
  38351 - guarded
  38352 - or
  38353 - closed
  38354 - against
  38355 - any
  38356 - traffic
  38357 - She
  38358 - was
  38359 - now
  38360 - familiar
  38361 - with
  38362 - the
  38363 - toothache
  38364 - from
  38365 - the
  38366 - dead-end
  38367 - ones
  38368 - that
  38369 - went
  38370 - into
  38371 - Nothing
  38372 - but
  38373 - there
  38374 - were
  38375 - also
  38376 - some
  38377 - into
  38378 - the
  38379 - Middle
  38380 - House
  38381 - that
  38382 - when
  38383 - she
  38384 - thought
  38385 - about
  38386 - them
  38387 - made
  38388 - her
  38389 - smell
  38390 - baking
  38391 - bread
  38392 - but
  38393 - it
  38394 - stopped
  38395 - as
  38396 - soon
  38397 - as
  38398 - she
  38399 - concentrated
  38400 - on
  38401 - a
  38402 - portal
  38403 - to
  38404 - somewhere
  38405 - else
  38406 - Someone‘s
  38407 - trying
  38408 - to
  38409 - get
  38410 - me
  38411 - to
  38412 - come
  38413 - to
  38414 - the
  38415 - Middle
  38416 - House
  38417 - portals
  38418 - thought
  38419 - Leaf
  38420 - It
  38421 - has
  38422 - to
  38423 - be
  38424 - either
  38425 - Arthur
  38426 - Dr
  38427 - Scamandros
  38428 - or
  38429 - an
  38430 - enemy
  38431 - Leaf
  38432 - looked
  38433 - over
  38434 - at
  38435 - the
  38436 - beastwort
  38437 - If
  38438 - it
  38439 - is
  38440 - an
  38441 - enemy
  38442 - they‘re
  38443 - going
  38444 - to
  38445 - get
  38446 - a
  38447 - very
  38448 - unpleasant
  38449 - surprise
  38450 - We‘re
  38451 - going
  38452 - to
  38453 - the
  38454 - Middle
  38455 - House
  38456 - Daisy
  38457 - said
  38458 - Leaf
  38459 - She
  38460 - jiggled
  38461 - the
  38462 - lead
  38463 - a
  38464 - couple
  38465 - of
  38466 - times
  38467 - then
  38468 - launched
  38469 - herself
  38470 - in
  38471 - the
  38472 - direction
  38473 - of
  38474 - the
  38475 - closest
  38476 - Middle
  38477 - House
  38478 - portal
  38479 - using
  38480 - the
  38481 - sword
  38482 - for
  38483 - propulsion
  38484 - She‘d
  38485 - been
  38486 - a
  38487 - bit
  38488 - worried
  38489 - that
  38490 - she‘d
  38491 - have
  38492 - to
  38493 - somehow
  38494 - drag
  38495 - the
  38496 - beastwort
  38497 - after
  38498 - her
  38499 - which
  38500 - would
  38501 - probably
  38502 - stretch
  38503 - her
  38504 - arms
  38505 - several
  38506 - inches
  38507 - longer
  38508 - but
  38509 - its
  38510 - many
  38511 - feet
  38512 - adopted
  38513 - a
  38514 - swimming
  38515 - motion
  38516 - and
  38517 - it
  38518 - came
  38519 - along
  38520 - beside
  38521 - Leaf
  38522 - so
  38523 - the
  38524 - lead
  38525 - was
  38526 - slack
  38527 - You‘re
  38528 - a
  38529 - good
  38530 - girl
  38531 - Leaf
  38532 - said
  38533 - absently
  38534 - She
  38535 - was
  38536 - thinking
  38537 - ahead
  38538 - and
  38539 - wondering
  38540 - if
  38541 - she
  38542 - could
  38543 - leave
  38544 - the
  38545 - Front
  38546 - Door
  38547 - when
  38548 - it
  38549 - opened
  38550 - into
  38551 - the
  38552 - House
  38553 - She‘d
  38554 - only
  38555 - met
  38556 - the
  38557 - previous
  38558 - Lieutenant
  38559 - Keeper
  38560 - once
  38561 - before
  38562 - but
  38563 - she
  38564 - clearly
  38565 - remembered
  38566 - him
  38567 - walking
  38568 - out
  38569 - on
  38570 - to
  38571 - Doorstop
  38572 - Hill
  38573 - in
  38574 - the
  38575 - Lower
  38576 - House
  38577 - Or
  38578 - did
  38579 - she
  38580 - Now
  38581 - that
  38582 - she
  38583 - thought
  38584 - about
  38585 - it
  38586 - Leaf
  38587 - couldn‘t
  38588 - recall
  38589 - how
  38590 - far
  38591 - he‘d
  38592 - come
  38593 - out
  38594 - and
  38595 - where
  38596 - his
  38597 - sword
  38598 - had
  38599 - been
  38600 - She
  38601 - had
  38602 - a
  38603 - sneaking
  38604 - and
  38605 - somewhat
  38606 - fearful
  38607 - half
  38608 - memory
  38609 - that
  38610 - the
  38611 - Lieutenant
  38612 - Keeper‘s
  38613 - sword
  38614 - had
  38615 - been
  38616 - in
  38617 - a
  38618 - scabbard
  38619 - and
  38620 - the
  38621 - end
  38622 - of
  38623 - the
  38624 - scabbard
  38625 - had
  38626 - remained
  38627 - inside
  38628 - the
  38629 - Door
  38630 - Leaf
  38631 - frowned
  38632 - She
  38633 - really
  38634 - couldn‘t
  38635 - remember
  38636 - and
  38637 - she
  38638 - told
  38639 - herself
  38640 - it
  38641 - was
  38642 - not
  38643 - the
  38644 - time
  38645 - to
  38646 - try
  38647 - She
  38648 - should
  38649 - be
  38650 - keeping
  38651 - track
  38652 - of
  38653 - where
  38654 - the
  38655 - Nithlings
  38656 - were
  38657 - to
  38658 - make
  38659 - sure
  38660 - she
  38661 - didn‘t
  38662 - get
  38663 - ambushed
  38664 - So
  38665 - she
  38666 - concentrated
  38667 - on
  38668 - intruders
  38669 - and
  38670 - found
  38671 - that
  38672 - while
  38673 - there
  38674 - were
  38675 - still
  38676 - several
  38677 - hundred
  38678 - Nithlings
  38679 - within
  38680 - the
  38681 - Front
  38682 - Door
  38683 - none
  38684 - of
  38685 - them
  38686 - were
  38687 - near
  38688 - her
  38689 - In
  38690 - fact
  38691 - they
  38692 - were
  38693 - all
  38694 - moving
  38695 - away
  38696 - to
  38697 - congregate
  38698 - around
  38699 - a
  38700 - particularly
  38701 - large
  38702 - pool
  38703 - of
  38704 - Nothing
  38705 - that
  38706 - was
  38707 - leaking
  38708 - in
  38709 - from
  38710 - what
  38711 - used
  38712 - to
  38713 - be
  38714 - a
  38715 - portal
  38716 - into
  38717 - the
  38718 - Great
  38719 - Maze
  38720 - I
  38721 - wonder
  38722 - what
  38723 - they‘re
  38724 - doing
  38725 - thought
  38726 - Leaf
  38727 - and
  38728 - she
  38729 - felt
  38730 - a
  38731 - strong
  38732 - compulsion
  38733 - to
  38734 - go
  38735 - and
  38736 - have
  38737 - an
  38738 - actual
  38739 - look
  38740 - But
  38741 - it
  38742 - was
  38743 - a
  38744 - bit
  38745 - like
  38746 - being
  38747 - told
  38748 - to
  38749 - do
  38750 - something
  38751 - by
  38752 - a
  38753 - parent
  38754 - Leaf
  38755 - ignored
  38756 - the
  38757 - feeling
  38758 - Instead
  38759 - it
  38760 - merely
  38761 - hardened
  38762 - her
  38763 - determination
  38764 - to
  38765 - get
  38766 - rid
  38767 - of
  38768 - the
  38769 - sword
  38770 - and
  38771 - stop
  38772 - being
  38773 - the
  38774 - Lieutenant
  38775 - Keeper
  38776 - As
  38777 - she‘d
  38778 - told
  38779 - Arthur
  38780 - quite
  38781 - some
  38782 - time
  38783 - ago
  38784 - Leaf
  38785 - did
  38786 - not
  38787 - want
  38788 - any
  38789 - more
  38790 - adventures
  38791 - As
  38792 - far
  38793 - as
  38794 - she
  38795 - was
  38796 - concerned
  38797 - she‘d
  38798 - had
  38799 - enough
  38800 - A
  38801 - small
  38802 - point
  38803 - of
  38804 - light
  38805 - appeared
  38806 - up
  38807 - ahead
  38808 - Leaf
  38809 - thought
  38810 - about
  38811 - going
  38812 - faster
  38813 - and
  38814 - straightened
  38815 - her
  38816 - wrist
  38817 - so
  38818 - the
  38819 - sword
  38820 - pointed
  38821 - directly
  38822 - at
  38823 - the
  38824 - portal
  38825 - She
  38826 - sped
  38827 - up
  38828 - the
  38829 - beastwort
  38830 - easily
  38831 - keeping
  38832 - pace
  38833 - Together
  38834 - they
  38835 - accelerated
  38836 - towards
  38837 - the
  38838 - portal
  38839 - which
  38840 - grew
  38841 - larger
  38842 - and
  38843 - became
  38844 - defined
  38845 - as
  38846 - a
  38847 - rectangular
  38848 - door
  38849 - of
  38850 - harsh
  38851 - white
  38852 - light
  38853 - A
  38854 - dozen
  38855 - feet
  38856 - away
  38857 - Leaf
  38858 - belatedly
  38859 - thought
  38860 - it
  38861 - might
  38862 - be
  38863 - a
  38864 - good
  38865 - idea
  38866 - to
  38867 - slow
  38868 - down
  38869 - rather
  38870 - than
  38871 - crash
  38872 - through
  38873 - into
  38874 - the
  38875 - Middle
  38876 - House
  38877 - with
  38878 - a
  38879 - three-ton
  38880 - creature
  38881 - on
  38882 - her
  38883 - heels
  38884 - But
  38885 - it
  38886 - was
  38887 - too
  38888 - late
  38889 - Frantically
  38890 - Leaf
  38891 - swung
  38892 - the
  38893 - sword
  38894 - to
  38895 - the
  38896 - right
  38897 - but
  38898 - that
  38899 - just
  38900 - meant
  38901 - she
  38902 - hit
  38903 - the
  38904 - side
  38905 - of
  38906 - the
  38907 - portal
  38908 - and
  38909 - was
  38910 - flung
  38911 - through
  38912 - it
  38913 - wrenching
  38914 - her
  38915 - arm
  38916 - She
  38917 - rolled
  38918 - across
  38919 - a
  38920 - thick
  38921 - carpet
  38922 - and
  38923 - collided
  38924 - with
  38925 - something
  38926 - wooden
  38927 - and
  38928 - fragile
  38929 - that
  38930 - broke
  38931 - The
  38932 - beastwort
  38933 - came
  38934 - through
  38935 - a
  38936 - second
  38937 - later
  38938 - right
  38939 - on
  38940 - top
  38941 - of
  38942 - Leaf
  38943 - She
  38944 - screamed
  38945 - but
  38946 - the
  38947 - creature
  38948 - simply
  38949 - danced
  38950 - across
  38951 - her
  38952 - its
  38953 - hundreds
  38954 - of
  38955 - legs
  38956 - exerting
  38957 - no
  38958 - more
  38959 - pressure
  38960 - than
  38961 - a
  38962 - small
  38963 - child
  38964 - though
  38965 - that
  38966 - was
  38967 - enough
  38968 - to
  38969 - temporarily

  39717 - Arthur‘ll
  39718 - fix
  39719 - it
  39720 - up
  39721 - said
  39722 - Suzy
  39723 - confidently
  39724 - The
  39725 - furry
  39726 - creature
  39727 - tattoos
  39728 - poked
  39729 - their
  39730 - heads
  39731 - out
  39732 - of
  39733 - their
  39734 - holes
  39735 - Lord
  39736 - Arthur
  39737 - has
  39738 - returned
  39739 - ”
  39740 - exclaimed
  39741 - Dr
  39742 - Scamandros
  39743 - Perhaps
  39744 - there
  39745 - is
  39746 - hope
  39747 - after—
  39748 - Uh
  39749 - he‘s
  39750 - not
  39751 - exactly
  39752 - back
  39753 - interrupted
  39754 - Suzy
  39755 - Oh
  39756 - said
  39757 - Dr
  39758 - Scamandros
  39759 - The
  39760 - furry
  39761 - creatures
  39762 - turned
  39763 - into
  39764 - doors
  39765 - that
  39766 - shut
  39767 - themselves
  39768 - and
  39769 - dwindled
  39770 - into
  39771 - tiny
  39772 - squares
  39773 - No
  39774 - one
  39775 - knows
  39776 - where
  39777 - he
  39778 - is
  39779 - added
  39780 - Suzy
  39781 - So
  39782 - he‘s
  39783 - probably
  39784 - doing
  39785 - something
  39786 - important
  39787 - Anyhow
  39788 - what
  39789 - we
  39790 - have
  39791 - to
  39792 - do
  39793 - is
  39794 - get
  39795 - in

  39803 - back
  39804 - get
  39805 - a
  39806 - force
  39807 - together
  39808 - –
  39809 - I‘ve
  39810 - got
  39811 - some
  39812 - of
  39813 - my
  39814 - Raiders
  39815 - working
  39816 - on
  39817 - that
  39818 - –
  39819 - get
  39820 - an
  39821 - elevator
  39822 - into
  39823 - the
  39824 - one
  39825 - shaft
  39826 - that‘s
  39827 - open
  39828 - and
  39829 - attack
  39830 - the
  39831 - Upper
  39832 - House
  39833 - so‘s
  39834 - we
  39835 - can
  39836 - get
  39837 - more
  39838 - shafts
  39839 - working
  39840 - Once

  39853 - Saturday
  39854 - and
  39855 - the
  39856 - Piper‘s
  39857 - lot
  39858 - and
  39859 - then
  39860 - open
  39861 - up
  39862 - the
  39863 - Incomparable
  39864 - Gardens
  39865 - and
  39866 - get
  39867 - in
  39868 - there
  39869 - to
  39870 - help
  39871 - Arthur
  39872 - so
  39873 - he
  39874 - doesn‘t
  39875 - ‘ave
  39876 - too
  39877 - much
  39878 - trouble

  39880 - Uh
  39881 - I‘m
  39882 - not
  39883 - sure
  39884 - if
  39885 - I
  39886 - follow
  39887 - all
  39888 - that

  39892 - Neither

  39894 - I
  39895 - said
  39896 - Giac
  39897 - Suzy
  39898 - sighed
  39899 - Orright
  39900 - One
  39901 - step
  39902 - at
  39903 - a
  39904 - time
  39905 - We
  39906 - get
  39907 - in
  39908 - the
  39909 - Front
  39910 - Door
  39911 - and
  39912 - get
  39913 - Leaf
  39914 - That‘s
  39915 - where
  39916 - you
  39917 - come
  39918 - in
  39919 - Doc
  39920 - Where‘s
  39921 - an
  39922 - entrance
  39923 - to
  39924 - the
  39925 - Front
  39926 - Door

  39929 - ”
  39930 - Ah
  39931 - I
  39932 - shall
  39933 - have
  39934 - to
  39935 - undertake
  39936 - a
  39937 - lengthy
  39938 - divination
  39939 - said
  39940 - Scamandros
  39941 - with
  39942 - a
  39943 - frown
  39944 - He
  39945 - thought
  39946 - for
  39947 - a
  39948 - moment
  39949 - and
  39950 - his
  39951 - frown
  39952 - ebbed
  39953 - away
  39954 - Or
  39955 - possibly
  39956 - I
  39957 - can
  39958 - simply
  39959 - ask
  39960 - one
  39961 - of
  39962 - the
  39963 - Binders
  39964 - ”
  39965 - Digby
  39966 - should
  39967 - know

  39969 - Suzy
  39970 - Let‘s
  39971 - track
  39972 - him
  39973 - down
  39974 - Come
  39975 - on
  39976 - ”
  39977 - But
  39978 - my
  39979 - spells
  39980 - –
  39981 - I‘m
  39982 - in
  39983 - the
  39984 - middle
  39985 - of
  39986 - a
  39987 - laborious
  39988 - procedure

  39990 - Dr
  39991 - Scamandros
  39992 - protested
  39993 - No

  39995 - said
  39996 - Suzy
  39997 - You
  39998 - said
  39999 - it
  40000 - yourself
  40001 - Let‘s
  40002 - go
  40003 - ”
  40004 - Scamandros
  40005 - shrugged
  40006 - his
  40007 - oversize
  40008 - greatcoat
  40009 - accentuating
  40010 - the
  40011 - movement
  40012 - Then
  40013 - he
  40014 - reached
  40015 - across
  40016 - his
  40017 - bench
  40018 - swept
  40019 - everything
  40020 - into
  40021 - one
  40022 - of
  40023 - the
  40024 - impossibly
  40025 - voluminous
  40026 - pockets
  40027 - on
  40028 - the
  40029 - inside
  40030 - of
  40031 - the
  40032 - coat
  40033 - and
  40034 - followed
  40035 - Suzy
  40036 - and
  40037 - Giac
  40038 - to
  40039 - the
  40040 - door
  40041 - Suzy
  40042 - was
  40043 - already
  40044 - calling
  40045 - out
  40046 - to
  40047 - some
  40048 - unseen

  40057 - Shortly
  40058 - thereafter
  40059 - Digby
  40060 - was
  40061 - found
  40062 - in
  40063 - the
  40064 - Press
  40065 - Room
  40066 - Drawing
  40067 - on
  40068 - a
  40069 - discarded
  40070 - proof
  40071 - with
  40072 - a
  40073 - pencil
  40074 - he
  40075 - quickly
  40076 - sketched
  40077 - a
  40078 - map
  40079 - to
  40080 - show
  40081 - them
  40082 - the
  40083 - way
  40084 - to
  40085 - the
  40086 - nearest
  40087 - entry

  40093 - is

  40099 - said
  40100 - And
  40101 - lies
  40102 - at
  40103 - the
  40104 - end
  40105 - of
  40106 - a
  40107 - corridor
  40108 - amply
  40109 - provided
  40110 - with
  40111 - murder
  40112 - holes
  40113 - an
  40114 - oil
  40115 - trap
  40116 - and
  40117 - so
  40118 - forth
  40119 - I
  40120 - shall
  40121 - write
  40122 - a
  40123 - note
  40124 - for
  40125 - the
  40126 - guards
  40127 - to
  40128 - let
  40129 - you—
  40130 - As
  40131 - he
  40132 - spoke
  40133 - a
  40134 - bell
  40135 - tolled
  40136 - in
  40137 - the
  40138 - keep

  40140 - times

  40142 - Digby

  40144 - his
  40145 - head
  40146 - to
  40147 - one
  40148 - side
  40149 - Hmmm
  40150 - that‘s
  40151 - synchronistically
  40152 - curious
  40153 - he
  40154 - said
  40155 - That
  40156 - is
  40157 - the

  40167 - I‘d
  40168 - best
  40169 - show

  40323 - At

  40377 - cocked
  40378 - their

  40381 - see

  41628 - While
  41629 - he
  41630 - was

  41675 - of

  41904 - voice
  41905 - lacked
  41906 - conviction
  41907 - and
  41908 - he
  41909 - found
  41910 - no
  41911 - rage
  41912 - He
  41913 - was
  41914 - going
  41915 - to
  41916 - try
  41917 - kicking
  41918 - them
  41919 - if
  41920 - it
  41921 - was
  41922 - possible
  41923 - but
  41924 - he
  41925 - knew
  41926 - it
  41927 - probably
  41928 - wouldn‘t
  41929 - be
  41930 - When
  41931 - the
  41932 - chains
  41933 - tightened
  41934 - up
  41935 - completely
  41936 - he
  41937 - would
  41938 - be
  41939 - held
  41940 - down
  41941 - against
  41942 - the
  41943 - clock
  41944 - face
  41945 - and
  41946 - the
  41947 - puppets
  41948 - would
  41949 - come
  41950 - at
  41951 - him
  41952 - from
  41953 - behind
  41954 - his
  41955 - head
  41956 - To
  41957 - kick
  41958 - them
  41959 - he‘d
  41960 - have
  41961 - to
  41962 - be
  41963 - a
  41964 - contortionist
  41965 - I‘ll
  41966 - bite
  41967 - too
  41968 - added
  41969 - Arthur
  41970 - Not
  41971 - that
  41972 - my
  41973 - teeth
  41974 - would
  41975 - do
  41976 - much
  41977 - to
  41978 - those
  41979 - puppets
  41980 - even
  41981 - if
  41982 - I
  41983 - could
  41984 - land
  41985 - a
  41986 - bite
  41987 - on
  41988 - them
  41989 - I‘d
  41990 - need
  41991 - much
  41992 - more
  41993 - serious
  41994 - teeth
  41995 - for
  41996 - that
  41997 - Or
  41998 - I
  41999 - could
  42000 - just
  42001 - give
  42002 - up
  42003 - Arthur
  42004 - banished
  42005 - that
  42006 - thought
  42007 - He
  42008 - wasn‘t
  42009 - going
  42010 - to
  42011 - give
  42012 - up
  42013 - I
  42014 - have
  42015 - to
  42016 - think
  42017 - outside
  42018 - the
  42019 - box
  42020 - like
  42021 - Eric
  42022 - is
  42023 - always
  42024 - going
  42025 - on
  42026 - about
  42027 - Maybe
  42028 - I
  42029 - could
  42030 - grow
  42031 - sharp
  42032 - teeth
  42033 - Or
  42034 - extra
  42035 - arms
  42036 - I
  42037 - could
  42038 - direct
  42039 - my
  42040 - power
  42041 - to
  42042 - change
  42043 - myself
  42044 - Arthur
  42045 - looked
  42046 - down
  42047 - at
  42048 - his
  42049 - manacled
  42050 - wrists
  42051 - and
  42052 - a
  42053 - new
  42054 - thought
  42055 - popped
  42056 - into
  42057 - his
  42058 - head
  42059 - Maybe
  42060 - I
  42061 - could
  42062 - make
  42063 - my
  42064 - hands
  42065 - really
  42066 - small
  42067 - and
  42068 - slip
  42069 - these
  42070 - manacles
  42071 - off
  42072 - He
  42073 - stared
  42074 - down
  42075 - at
  42076 - his
  42077 - wrists
  42078 - and
  42079 - concentrated
  42080 - on
  42081 - them
  42082 - willing
  42083 - them
  42084 - to
  42085 - become
  42086 - thinner
  42087 - to
  42088 - shrink
  42089 - down
  42090 - Nothing
  42091 - happened
  42092 - save
  42093 - the
  42094 - tick
  42095 - of
  42096 - the
  42097 - clock
  42098 - and
  42099 - the
  42100 - rattle
  42101 - of
  42102 - the
  42103 - chain
  42104 - as
  42105 - another
  42106 - link
  42107 - crept
  42108 - into
  42109 - its
  42110 - neighbour
  42111 - and
  42112 - became
  42113 - one
  42114 - Arthur
  42115 - kept
  42116 - concentrating
  42117 - for
  42118 - the
  42119 - next
  42120 - ten
  42121 - minutes
  42122 - but
  42123 - it
  42124 - didn‘t
  42125 - work
  42126 - His
  42127 - wrists
  42128 - and
  42129 - hands
  42130 - remained
  42131 - unchanged
  42132 - He
  42133 - was
  42134 - so
  42135 - intent
  42136 - on
  42137 - forcing
  42138 - his
  42139 - body
  42140 - to
  42141 - reshape
  42142 - itself
  42143 - that
  42144 - he
  42145 - didn‘t
  42146 - notice
  42147 - Lord
  42148 - Sunday
  42149 - till
  42150 - the
  42151 - Denizen
  42152 - was
  42153 - standing
  42154 - in
  42155 - front
  42156 - of
  42157 - him
  42158 - on
  42159 - the
  42160 - rim
  42161 - of
  42162 - the
  42163 - clock
  42164 - face
  42165 - It
  42166 - lacks
  42167 - but
  42168 - a
  42169 - quarter
  42170 - hour
  42171 - to
  42172 - twelve
  42173 - said
  42174 - Lord
  42175 - Sunday
  42176 - Will
  42177 - you
  42178 - give
  42179 - me
  42180 - the
  42181 - Keys
  42182 - and
  42183 - the
  42184 - Atlas
  42185 - ”
  42186 - Arthur
  42187 - looked
  42188 - up
  42189 - at
  42190 - him
  42191 - Though
  42192 - many
  42193 - hours
  42194 - had
  42195 - passed
  42196 - the
  42197 - sun
  42198 - in
  42199 - the
  42200 - Incomparable
  42201 - Gardens
  42202 - moved
  42203 - slowly
  42204 - and
  42205 - had
  42206 - barely
  42207 - shifted
  42208 - against
  42209 - the
  42210 - painted
  42211 - sky
  42212 - Lord
  42213 - Sunday
  42214 - stood
  42215 - so
  42216 - the
  42217 - disc
  42218 - of
  42219 - the
  42220 - sun
  42221 - was
  42222 - behind
  42223 - his
  42224 - head
  42225 - giving
  42226 - him
  42227 - a
  42228 - bright
  42229 - and
  42230 - blinding
  42231 - halo
  42232 - No
  42233 - said
  42234 - Arthur
  42235 - slowly
  42236 - I
  42237 - won‘t
  42238 - ”
  42239 - Lord
  42240 - Sunday
  42241 - frowned
  42242 - and
  42243 - turned
  42244 - away
  42245 - Arthur
  42246 - blinked
  42247 - and
  42248 - looked
  42249 - up
  42250 - but
  42251 - saw
  42252 - no
  42253 - dragonfly
  42254 - Wherever
  42255 - Lord
  42256 - Sunday
  42257 - had
  42258 - come
  42259 - from
  42260 - it
  42261 - was
  42262 - not
  42263 - on
  42264 - one
  42265 - of
  42266 - his
  42267 - winged
  42268 - creatures
  42269 - I
  42270 - will
  42271 - wait
  42272 - said
  42273 - Lord
  42274 - Sunday
  42275 - Perhaps
  42276 - you
  42277 - will
  42278 - reconsider
  42279 - afterwards
  42280 - ”
  42281 - Arthur
  42282 - craned
  42283 - his
  42284 - head
  42285 - around
  42286 - Sunday
  42287 - had
  42288 - sat
  42289 - down
  42290 - just
  42291 - behind
  42292 - the
  42293 - clock
  42294 - on
  42295 - a
  42296 - striped
  42297 - canvas
  42298 - chair
  42299 - that
  42300 - had
  42301 - not
  42302 - been
  42303 - there
  42304 - before
  42305 - A
  42306 - Denizen
  42307 - in
  42308 - a
  42309 - butler‘s
  42310 - uniform
  42311 - who
  42312 - looked
  42313 - a
  42314 - bit
  42315 - like
  42316 - Sneezer
  42317 - though
  42318 - he
  42319 - had
  42320 - green
  42321 - skin
  42322 - was
  42323 - handing
  42324 - him
  42325 - a
  42326 - tall
  42327 - pinkish
  42328 - drink
  42329 - Beyond
  42330 - the
  42331 - butler
  42332 - a
  42333 - tall-legged
  42334 - beetle
  42335 - the
  42336 - size
  42337 - of
  42338 - a
  42339 - van
  42340 - munched
  42341 - on
  42342 - the
  42343 - leaves
  42344 - of
  42345 - a
  42346 - tree
  42347 - The
  42348 - beetle
  42349 - had
  42350 - a
  42351 - gilded
  42352 - throne
  42353 - on
  42354 - its
  42355 - back
  42356 - and
  42357 - several
  42358 - smaller
  42359 - cane
  42360 - chairs
  42361 - behind
  42362 - it
  42363 - and
  42364 - was
  42365 - evidently
  42366 - Sunday‘s
  42367 - choice
  42368 - of
  42369 - ground
  42370 - transportation
  42371 - The
  42372 - clock
  42373 - ticked
  42374 - Arthur
  42375 - watched
  42376 - the
  42377 - minute
  42378 - hand
  42379 - move
  42380 - to
  42381 - three
  42382 - minutes
  42383 - to
  42384 - twelve
  42385 - The
  42386 - chain
  42387 - tightened
  42388 - again
  42389 - and
  42390 - he
  42391 - lay
  42392 - back
  42393 - and
  42394 - stared
  42395 - at
  42396 - the
  42397 - sky
  42398 - It
  42399 - will
  42400 - only
  42401 - be
  42402 - a
  42403 - short
  42404 - pain
  42405 - he
  42406 - thought
  42407 - Followed
  42408 - by
  42409 - an
  42410 - ache
  42411 - that
  42412 - will
  42413 - pass
  42414 - in
  42415 - an
  42416 - hour
  42417 - or
  42418 - two
  42419 - as
  42420 - my
  42421 - eyes
  42422 - grow
  42423 - back
  42424 - It‘s
  42425 - not
  42426 - like
  42427 - when
  42428 - I
  42429 - was
  42430 - human…
  42431 - Not
  42432 - like
  42433 - when
  42434 - I
  42435 - was
  42436 - human
  42437 - he
  42438 - whispered
  42439 - What
  42440 - ”
  42441 - asked
  42442 - Lord
  42443 - Sunday
  42444 - What
  42445 - did
  42446 - you
  42447 - say
  42448 - Did
  42449 - you
  42450 - agree
  42451 - to
  42452 - my
  42453 - proposal

  42455 - No

  42457 - Arthur
  42458 - shouted
  42459 - He
  42460 - shut
  42461 - his
  42462 - eyes
  42463 - He
  42464 - wasn‘t
  42465 - sure
  42466 - he
  42467 - could
  42468 - stand
  42469 - the
  42470 - pain
  42471 - but
  42472 - he
  42473 - was
  42474 - absolutely
  42475 - sure
  42476 - he
  42477 - didn‘t
  42478 - want
  42479 - to
  42480 - see
  42481 - it
  42482 - happen
  42483 - Do
  42484 - your
  42485 - worst
  42486 - ”
  42487 - The
  42488 - last
  42489 - few
  42490 - minutes
  42491 - stretched
  42492 - out
  42493 - for
  42494 - a
  42495 - very
  42496 - long
  42497 - time
  42498 - Arthur
  42499 - could
  42500 - see
  42501 - the
  42502 - red
  42503 - glare
  42504 - of
  42505 - the
  42506 - sun
  42507 - through
  42508 - his
  42509 - eyelids
  42510 - He
  42511 - scrunched
  42512 - his
  42513 - eyes
  42514 - more
  42515 - tightly
  42516 - closed
  42517 - and
  42518 - tried
  42519 - to
  42520 - think
  42521 - of
  42522 - other
  42523 - nicer
  42524 - things
  42525 - Of
  42526 - Bob‘s
  42527 - music
  42528 - and
  42529 - of
  42530 - his
  42531 - own
  42532 - songs
  42533 - He
  42534 - tried
  42535 - to
  42536 - hum
  42537 - one
  42538 - but
  42539 - he
  42540 - couldn‘t
  42541 - remember
  42542 - it
  42543 - and
  42544 - there
  42545 - were
  42546 - other
  42547 - songs
  42548 - that
  42549 - he
  42550 - should
  42551 - be
  42552 - able
  42553 - to

  42555 - but
  42556 - he
  42557 - couldn‘t
  42558 - think
  42559 - how
  42560 - they
  42561 - went
  42562 - either
  42563 - not
  42564 - even
  42565 - classic
  42566 - songs

  42568 - played
  42569 - a
  42570 - million
  42571 - times
  42572 - himself
  42573 - on

  42575 - keyboard

  42577 - The
  42578 - clock
  42579 - began
  42580 - to
  42581 - strike
  42582 - Arthur
  42583 - tensed
  42584 - as

  42586 - heard
  42587 - the
  42588 - trapdoor
  42589 - fly
  42590 - open
  42591 - his
  42592 - whole

  42597 - bowstring

  42599 - ground
  42600 - his

  42603 - to
  42604 - keep
  42605 - his
  42606 - mouth
  42607 - shut

  42610 - heard
  42611 - the
  42612 - whirr
  42613 - and
  42614 - cackle
  42615 - of
  42616 - the
  42617 - clockwork
  42618 - puppets
  42619 - A
  42620 - shadow

  42623 - red
  42624 - blur
  42625 - of
  42626 - the
  42627 - sun…
  42628 - I
  42629 - will
  42630 - not

  42634 - furiously

  42643 - any

  42645 - The
  42646 - clock
  42647 - continued
  42648 - to
  42649 - strike
  42650 - slowly
  42651 - counting
  42652 - to
  42653 - twelve
  42654 - Bong
  42655 - Bong
  42656 - Bong
  42657 - Bong
  42658 - There
  42659 - was
  42660 - no
  42661 - pain
  42662 - Arthur
  42663 - felt
  42664 - nothing
  42665 - not
  42666 - the
  42667 - slightest
  42668 - touch
  42669 - on
  42670 - his
  42671 - eyelids
  42672 - or
  42673 - face
  42674 - Bong
  42675 - Bong
  42676 - Bong
  42677 - He
  42678 - gulped
  42679 - unable
  42680 - to
  42681 - stop
  42682 - himself
  42683 - and
  42684 - his
  42685 - eyes
  42686 - ever
  42687 - so
  42688 - slightly
  42689 - unscrunched
  42690 - Bong
  42691 - Bong
  42692 - Only
  42693 - two
  42694 - strikes
  42695 - to
  42696 - go
  42697 - and
  42698 - still
  42699 - nothing
  42700 - had
  42701 - touched
  42702 - his
  42703 - eyes
  42704 - Arthur
  42705 - took
  42706 - in
  42707 - a
  42708 - deep
  42709 - racking
  42710 - breath…
  42711 - Bong
  42712 - The
  42713 - last
  42714 - strike
  42715 - was
  42716 - taking
  42717 - forever
  42718 - and
  42719 - the
  42720 - puppets
  42721 - still
  42722 - hadn‘t
  42723 - attacked
  42724 - They
  42725 - only
  42726 - had
  42727 - the
  42728 - time
  42729 - it
  42730 - took
  42731 - for
  42732 - the
  42733 - clock
  42734 - to
  42735 - sound
  42736 - the
  42737 - twelve
  42738 - chimes
  42739 - Come
  42740 - on
  42741 - ”
  42742 - shouted
  42743 - Arthur
  42744 - Bong
  42745 - Arthur
  42746 - heard
  42747 - the
  42748 - whirr
  42749 - and
  42750 - the
  42751 - clatter
  42752 - of
  42753 - the
  42754 - puppets‘
  42755 - wooden
  42756 - feet
  42757 - and
  42758 - the
  42759 - slap
  42760 - of
  42761 - the
  42762 - trapdoor
  42763 - closing
  42764 - Slowly
  42765 - ever
  42766 - so
  42767 - slowly
  42768 - he
  42769 - opened
  42770 - his
  42771 - eyes
  42772 - Lord
  42773 - Sunday
  42774 - was
  42775 - standing
  42776 - near
  42777 - him
  42778 - sipping
  42779 - his
  42780 - drink
  42781 - You
  42782 - are
  42783 - brave
  42784 - he
  42785 - said
  42786 - Braver
  42787 - than
  42788 - I
  42789 - might
  42790 - have
  42791 - expected
  42792 - from
  42793 - a
  42794 - mortal
  42795 - Yet
  42796 - I
  42797 - think
  42798 - you
  42799 - will
  42800 - not
  42801 - be
  42802 - so
  42803 - brave
  42804 - next
  42805 - time
  42806 - ”
  42807 - Next
  42808 - time…
  42809 - whispered
  42810 - Arthur
  42811 - You
  42812 - must
  42813 - give
  42814 - me
  42815 - the
  42816 - Keys
  42817 - and
  42818 - the
  42819 - Atlas
  42820 - said
  42821 - Lord
  42822 - Sunday
  42823 - It
  42824 - is
  42825 - the
  42826 - only
  42827 - hope
  42828 - for
  42829 - the
  42830 - House
  42831 - and
  42832 - the
  42833 - Secondary
  42834 - Realms

  42836 - Arthur
  42837 - stared
  42838 - up
  42839 - at
  42840 - him
  42841 - his
  42842 - mind
  42843 - racing
  42844 - fuelled
  42845 - by
  42846 - fear-induced
  42847 - adrenaline
  42848 - You
  42849 - can‘t
  42850 - actually
  42851 - hurt
  42852 - me
  42853 - he
  42854 - said
  42855 - with
  42856 - sudden
  42857 - realisation
  42858 - That
  42859 - would
  42860 - be
  42861 - like
  42862 - forcing
  42863 - me
  42864 - to
  42865 - hand
  42866 - over
  42867 - the
  42868 - Keys
  42869 - You
  42870 - can
  42871 - try
  42872 - to
  42873 - scare
  42874 - me
  42875 - and
  42876 - that‘s
  42877 - it
  42878 - ”
  42879 - Lord
  42880 - Sunday
  42881 - gave
  42882 - him
  42883 - a
  42884 - slight
  42885 - unfriendly
  42886 - smile
  42887 - and
  42888 - stepped
  42889 - off
  42890 - the
  42891 - clock
  42892 - face
  42893 - I‘m
  42894 - not
  42895 - scared

  42897 - shouted
  42898 - Arthur
  42899 - He
  42900 - tried
  42901 - to
  42902 - shout
  42903 - it
  42904 - again
  42905 - but
  42906 - he
  42907 - couldn‘t
  42908 - Because
  42909 - he
  42910 - was
  42911 - scared
  42912 - He
  42913 - didn‘t
  42914 - know
  42915 - if
  42916 - he
  42917 - was
  42918 - right
  42919 - about
  42920 - the
  42921 - Keys
  42922 - Maybe
  42923 - the
  42924 - next
  42925 - time
  42926 - the
  42927 - clock
  42928 - struck
  42929 - twelve
  42930 - the
  42931 - puppets
  42932 - would
  42933 - take
  42934 - his
  42935 - eyes
  42936 - There
  42937 - was
  42938 - a
  42939 - soft
  42940 - patter
  42941 - in
  42942 - the
  42943 - grass
  42944 - near
  42945 - the
  42946 - clock
  42947 - Arthur
  42948 - lifted
  42949 - his
  42950 - head
  42951 - and
  42952 - watched
  42953 - the
  42954 - beetle
  42955 - race
  42956 - past
  42957 - with
  42958 - Lord
  42959 - Sunday
  42960 - and
  42961 - several
  42962 - of
  42963 - his
  42964 - servants
  42965 - on
  42966 - board
  42967 - The
  42968 - beetle
  42969 - went
  42970 - very
  42971 - close
  42972 - to
  42973 - the
  42974 - plants
  42975 - where
  42976 - Elephant
  42977 - was
  42978 - hiding
  42979 - Arthur
  42980 - held
  42981 - his
  42982 - breath
  42983 - as
  42984 - it
  42985 - went
  42986 - by
  42987 - brushing
  42988 - the
  42989 - shrubs
  42990 - aside
  42991 - before
  42992 - disappearing
  42993 - over
  42994 - the
  42995 - edge
  42996 - of
  42997 - the
  42998 - terrace
  42999 - Elephant
  43000 - emerged
  43001 - a
  43002 - minute
  43003 - later
  43004 - and
  43005 - crossed
  43006 - the
  43007 - grass
  43008 - He
  43009 - gripped
  43010 - one
  43011 - of
  43012 - the
  43013 - clock‘s
  43014 - numerals
  43015 - with
  43016 - his
  43017 - trunk
  43018 - and
  43019 - used
  43020 - that
  43021 - to
  43022 - help
  43023 - lever
  43024 - himself
  43025 - up
  43026 - on
  43027 - to
  43028 - the
  43029 - clock
  43030 - face
  43031 - before
  43032 - trotting
  43033 - over
  43034 - to
  43035 - Arthur
  43036 - I‘ve
  43037 - still

  43045 - twelve

  43053 - can‘t
  43054 - just
  43055 - wait
  43056 - for

  43060 - took
  43061 - weeks
  43062 - to

  43069 - Elephant
  43070 - nodded
  43071 - I
  43072 - didn‘t
  43073 - ask
  43074 - before
  43075 - said
  43076 - Arthur
  43077 - Because
  43078 - I
  43079 - didn‘t
  43080 - think
  43081 - of
  43082 - it
  43083 - But
  43084 - can
  43085 - you
  43086 - talk
  43087 - now

  43089 - Elephant
  43090 - shook
  43091 - his
  43092 - head
  43093 - slowly
  43094 - and
  43095 - let
  43096 - out
  43097 - a
  43098 - soft
  43099 - negative
  43100 - boom
  43101 - I
  43102 - thought
  43103 - maybe
  43104 - I
  43105 - could
  43106 - send
  43107 - you
  43108 - to
  43109 - find

  43121 - can‘t
  43122 - talk…it‘s
  43123 - not
  43124 - that
  43125 - I
  43126 - want
  43127 - you
  43128 - to
  43129 - go
  43130 - anywhere…
  43131 - Elephant
  43132 - nodded
  43133 - and
  43134 - sat
  43135 - down
  43136 - next
  43137 - to
  43138 - Arthur
  43139 - with
  43140 - a
  43141 - loud
  43142 - thud
  43143 - Arthur
  43144 - kept
  43145 - staring
  43146 - at
  43147 - the
  43148 - sky
  43149 - busy
  43150 - thinking
  43151 - Maybe
  43152 - you
  43153 - could
  43154 - go
  43155 - up
  43156 - the
  43157 - hill
  43158 - behind
  43159 - us
  43160 - he
  43161 - said
  43162 - slowly
  43163 - That‘s
  43164 - where
  43165 - Sunday‘s
  43166 - Noon
  43167 - took

  43188 - Elephant
  43189 - lumbered
  43190 - back
  43191 - upright
  43192 - and
  43193 - let
  43194 - out
  43195 - a
  43196 - short
  43197 - eager
  43198 - trumpet
  43199 - OK

  43201 - Arthur
  43202 - You
  43203 - go
  43204 - and
  43205 - take
  43206 - a

  43228 - touch

  43239 - too
  43240 - dangerous

  43242 - Elephant
  43243 - nodded
  43244 - saluted
  43245 - with
  43246 - his
  43247 - trunk
  43248 - and

  43317 - Leaf
  43318 - shrieked

  43322 - pain
  43323 - coursed
  43324 - through

  45576 - we‘re
  45577 - going
  45578 - to
  45579 - do
  45580 - I
  45581 - mean
  45582 - ”
  45583 - She
  45584 - waited
  45585 - for
  45586 - a
  45587 - few
  45588 - seconds
  45589 - but
  45590 - there
  45591 - were
  45592 - no
  45593 - more
  45594 - questions
  45595 - Let‘s
  45596 - go
  45597 - then
  45598 - said
  45599 - Suzy
  45600 - with
  45601 - a
  45602 - negligent
  45603 - wave
  45604 - of
  45605 - her
  45606 - hand
  45607 - The
  45608 - watching
  45609 - sergeants
  45610 - scowled
  45611 - as
  45612 - Suzy‘s
  45613 - Raiders
  45614 - ambled
  45615 - off
  45616 - after
  45617 - her
  45618 - in
  45619 - no
  45620 - particular
  45621 - order
  45622 - and
  45623 - with
  45624 - no
  45625 - one
  45626 - purposefully
  45627 - in
  45628 - step
  45629 - with
  45630 - anyone
  45631 - else
  45632 - As
  45633 - the
  45634 - crowd
  45635 - opened
  45636 - up
  45637 - a
  45638 - little
  45639 - Leaf
  45640 - saw
  45641 - that
  45642 - in
  45643 - addition
  45644 - to
  45645 - their
  45646 - many
  45647 - and
  45648 - varied
  45649 - personal
  45650 - armaments
  45651 - –
  45652 - and
  45653 - some
  45654 - of
  45655 - them
  45656 - were
  45657 - liberally
  45658 - festooned
  45659 - with
  45660 - weapons
  45661 - –
  45662 - a
  45663 - trio
  45664 - of
  45665 - hooded-and-
  45666 - cloaked
  45667 - Piper‘s
  45668 - children
  45669 - who‘d
  45670 - come
  45671 - out
  45672 - from
  45673 - the
  45674 - shadow
  45675 - of
  45676 - the
  45677 - inner
  45678 - wall
  45679 - were
  45680 - pushing
  45681 - a
  45682 - small
  45683 - cannon
  45684 - and
  45685 - a
  45686 - wheelbarrow
  45687 - loaded
  45688 - with
  45689 - small
  45690 - Nothing-powder
  45691 - kegs
  45692 - and
  45693 - cannonballs
  45694 - Suzy
  45695 - saw
  45696 - them
  45697 - too
  45698 - and
  45699 - looked
  45700 - at
  45701 - Fred
  45702 - who
  45703 - winked
  45704 - Guess
  45705 - they
  45706 - didn‘t
  45707 - stay
  45708 - arrested
  45709 - he
  45710 - said
  45711 - quietly
  45712 - CHAPTER
  45713 - NINETEEN
  45714 - The
  45715 - hour
  45716 - hand
  45717 - of
  45718 - the
  45719 - clock
  45720 - moved
  45721 - to
  45722 - the
  45723 - two
  45724 - as
  45725 - the
  45726 - minute
  45727 - hand
  45728 - passed
  45729 - twelve
  45730 - Two
  45731 - hours
  45732 - had
  45733 - gone
  45734 - by
  45735 - since
  45736 - Elephant
  45737 - had
  45738 - left
  45739 - to
  45740 - climb
  45741 - the
  45742 - hill
  45743 - in
  45744 - search
  45745 - of
  45746 - the
  45747 - silver
  45748 - net
  45749 - and
  45750 - the
  45751 - Fifth
  45752 - and
  45753 - Sixth
  45754 - Keys
  45755 - Arthur
  45756 - sat
  45757 - cross-legged
  45758 - near
  45759 - the
  45760 - nine
  45761 - on
  45762 - the
  45763 - clock
  45764 - He
  45765 - had
  45766 - been
  45767 - trying
  45768 - to
  45769 - distract
  45770 - himself
  45771 - by
  45772 - thinking
  45773 - of
  45774 - nice
  45775 - things
  45776 - but
  45777 - had
  45778 - only
  45779 - become
  45780 - alarmed
  45781 - at
  45782 - how
  45783 - much
  45784 - of
  45785 - his
  45786 - own
  45787 - life
  45788 - had
  45789 - become
  45790 - hard
  45791 - to
  45792 - remember
  45793 - Important
  45794 - memories
  45795 - –
  45796 - of
  45797 - his
  45798 - family
  45799 - life
  45800 - his
  45801 - friends
  45802 - the
  45803 - schools
  45804 - he‘d
  45805 - been
  45806 - to
  45807 - –
  45808 - they
  45809 - were
  45810 - fading
  45811 - and
  45812 - he
  45813 - could
  45814 - only
  45815 - remember
  45816 - them
  45817 - with
  45818 - great
  45819 - effort
  45820 - tracking
  45821 - down
  45822 - scant
  45823 - threads
  45824 - of
  45825 - memory
  45826 - and
  45827 - binding
  45828 - them
  45829 - together
  45830 - He
  45831 - was
  45832 - afraid
  45833 - but
  45834 - not
  45835 - of
  45836 - the
  45837 - puppets
  45838 - and
  45839 - the
  45840 - blinding
  45841 - that
  45842 - might
  45843 - be
  45844 - waiting
  45845 - in
  45846 - ten
  45847 - hours
  45848 - Arthur
  45849 - was
  45850 - afraid
  45851 - because
  45852 - he
  45853 - felt
  45854 - his
  45855 - human
  45856 - life
  45857 - slipping
  45858 - away
  45859 - from
  45860 - him
  45861 - Unless
  45862 - he
  45863 - really
  45864 - concentrated
  45865 - he
  45866 - had
  45867 - difficulty
  45868 - even
  45869 - bringing
  45870 - an
  45871 - image
  45872 - of
  45873 - all
  45874 - his
  45875 - brothers
  45876 - and
  45877 - sisters
  45878 - into
  45879 - his
  45880 - head
  45881 - Apart
  45882 - from
  45883 - Michaeli
  45884 - and
  45885 - Eric
  45886 - whom
  45887 - he
  45888 - had
  45889 - seen
  45890 - most
  45891 - recently
  45892 - he
  45893 - could
  45894 - not
  45895 - easily
  45896 - visualise
  45897 - the
  45898 - others
  45899 - or
  45900 - recall
  45901 - such
  45902 - simple
  45903 - things
  45904 - as
  45905 - the
  45906 - exact
  45907 - color
  45908 - of
  45909 - their
  45910 - hair
  45911 - He
  45912 - was
  45913 - concentrating
  45914 - on
  45915 - remembering
  45916 - his
  45917 - room
  45918 - in
  45919 - the
  45920 - old
  45921 - house
  45922 - the
  45923 - one
  45924 - he‘d
  45925 - lived
  45926 - in
  45927 - longest
  45928 - when
  45929 - a
  45930 - very
  45931 - faint
  45932 - and
  45933 - distant
  45934 - noise
  45935 - distracted
  45936 - him
  45937 - He
  45938 - stood
  45939 - up
  45940 - the
  45941 - chains
  45942 - at
  45943 - their
  45944 - maximum
  45945 - extension
  45946 - and
  45947 - listened
  45948 - The
  45949 - sound
  45950 - came
  45951 - again
  45952 - and
  45953 - Arthur
  45954 - clenched
  45955 - his
  45956 - fists
  45957 - and
  45958 - strained
  45959 - against
  45960 - the
  45961 - chains
  45962 - It
  45963 - was
  45964 - the
  45965 - trumpet
  45966 - call
  45967 - of
  45968 - Elephant
  45969 - coming
  45970 - from
  45971 - far
  45972 - far
  45973 - away
  45974 - He
  45975 - sounded
  45976 - distressed
  45977 - and
  45978 - in
  45979 - pain
  45980 - It
  45981 - came
  45982 - again
  45983 - twice
  45984 - more
  45985 - weaker
  45986 - each
  45987 - time
  45988 - then
  45989 - there
  45990 - was
  45991 - silence
  45992 - save
  45993 - for
  45994 - the
  45995 - ticking
  45996 - of
  45997 - the
  45998 - clock
  45999 - Elephant
  46000 - ”
  46001 - Arthur
  46002 - screamed
  46003 - throwing
  46004 - himself
  46005 - at
  46006 - the
  46007 - rim
  46008 - of
  46009 - the
  46010 - clock
  46011 - Golden
  46012 - blood
  46013 - streamed
  46014 - from
  46015 - his
  46016 - wrists
  46017 - as
  46018 - he
  46019 - raged
  46020 - against
  46021 - the
  46022 - chains
  46023 - the
  46024 - manacles
  46025 - cutting
  46026 - deep
  46027 - even
  46028 - into
  46029 - his
  46030 - toughened
  46031 - skin
  46032 - But
  46033 - it
  46034 - was
  46035 - no
  46036 - use
  46037 - Arthur
  46038 - could
  46039 - not
  46040 - shift
  46041 - the
  46042 - manacles
  46043 - or
  46044 - the
  46045 - chains
  46046 - and
  46047 - at
  46048 - last
  46049 - he
  46050 - fell
  46051 - down
  46052 - and
  46053 - lay
  46054 - sobbing
  46055 - in
  46056 - a
  46057 - pool
  46058 - of
  46059 - his
  46060 - own
  46061 - blood
  46062 - oblivious
  46063 - to
  46064 - the
  46065 - pain
  46066 - Elephant…
  46067 - he
  46068 - whispered
  46069 - I
  46070 - never
  46071 - should
  46072 - have
  46073 - sent
  46074 - you
  46075 - he
  46076 - thought
  46077 - bleakly
  46078 - I
  46079 - never
  46080 - should
  46081 - have
  46082 - brought
  46083 - you
  46084 - to
  46085 - life
  46086 - Slowly
  46087 - he
  46088 - staggered
  46089 - to
  46090 - his
  46091 - feet
  46092 - and
  46093 - stared
  46094 - up
  46095 - at
  46096 - the
  46097 - next
  46098 - terrace
  46099 - hoping
  46100 - against
  46101 - hope
  46102 - that
  46103 - he
  46104 - would
  46105 - see
  46106 - a
  46107 - small
  46108 - yellow
  46109 - elephant
  46110 - appear
  46111 - on
  46112 - the
  46113 - crest
  46114 - and
  46115 - come
  46116 - stomping
  46117 - down
  46118 - towards
  46119 - him
  46120 - Elephant
  46121 - did
  46122 - not
  46123 - appear
  46124 - But
  46125 - Arthur
  46126 - heard
  46127 - a
  46128 - humming
  46129 - noise
  46130 - like
  46131 - but
  46132 - not
  46133 - exactly
  46134 - the
  46135 - same
  46136 - as
  46137 - the
  46138 - sound
  46139 - of
  46140 - one
  46141 - of
  46142 - Sunday‘s
  46143 - dragonflies
  46144 - He
  46145 - looked
  46146 - around
  46147 - urgently
  46148 - but
  46149 - there
  46150 - was
  46151 - no
  46152 - dragonfly
  46153 - in
  46154 - sight
  46155 - The
  46156 - humming
  46157 - grew
  46158 - louder
  46159 - and
  46160 - louder
  46161 - as
  46162 - if
  46163 - whatever
  46164 - made
  46165 - it
  46166 - was
  46167 - coming
  46168 - straight
  46169 - for
  46170 - him
  46171 - Arthur
  46172 - turned
  46173 - wildly
  46174 - chains
  46175 - clanking
  46176 - as
  46177 - he
  46178 - tried
  46179 - to
  46180 - work
  46181 - out
  46182 - where
  46183 - and
  46184 - what
  46185 - it
  46186 - was
  46187 - Then
  46188 - he
  46189 - saw
  46190 - it
  46191 - The
  46192 - silver
  46193 - net
  46194 - that
  46195 - Sunday
  46196 - had
  46197 - used
  46198 - to
  46199 - trap
  46200 - his
  46201 - Keys
  46202 - was
  46203 - zooming
  46204 - towards
  46205 - him
  46206 - only
  46207 - a
  46208 - foot
  46209 - above
  46210 - the
  46211 - grass
  46212 - Like
  46213 - some
  46214 - demented
  46215 - hovercraft
  46216 - it
  46217 - whooshed
  46218 - down
  46219 - the
  46220 - slope
  46221 - jumped
  46222 - the
  46223 - number
  46224 - twelve
  46225 - on
  46226 - the
  46227 - clock
  46228 - and
  46229 - smashed
  46230 - into
  46231 - Arthur
  46232 - knocking
  46233 - him
  46234 - to
  46235 - the
  46236 - ground
  46237 - Arthur
  46238 - grabbed
  46239 - it
  46240 - as
  46241 - it
  46242 - hit
  46243 - but
  46244 - it
  46245 - flopped
  46246 - around
  46247 - in
  46248 - his
  46249 - grasp
  46250 - until
  46251 - it
  46252 - disgorged
  46253 - its
  46254 - contents
  46255 - –
  46256 - a
  46257 - mirror
  46258 - and
  46259 - a
  46260 - quill
  46261 - pen
  46262 - that
  46263 - leaped
  46264 - into
  46265 - his
  46266 - hands
  46267 - As
  46268 - Arthur
  46269 - touched
  46270 - the
  46271 - Fifth
  46272 - and
  46273 - Sixth
  46274 - Keys
  46275 - he
  46276 - felt
  46277 - power
  46278 - flow
  46279 - into
  46280 - him
  46281 - and
  46282 - all
  46283 - his
  46284 - self-doubts
  46285 - and
  46286 - fears
  46287 - were
  46288 - washed
  46289 - away
  46290 - He
  46291 - stood
  46292 - up
  46293 - and
  46294 - holding
  46295 - both
  46296 - Keys
  46297 - above
  46298 - his
  46299 - head
  46300 - spoke
  46301 - in
  46302 - a
  46303 - deep
  46304 - and
  46305 - commanding
  46306 - voice
  46307 - that
  46308 - was
  46309 - only
  46310 - slightly
  46311 - reminiscent
  46312 - of
  46313 - his
  46314 - own
  46315 - Release
  46316 - me
  46317 - ”
  46318 - He
  46319 - felt
  46320 - resistance
  46321 - in
  46322 - the
  46323 - sorcerous
  46324 - steel
  46325 - and
  46326 - from
  46327 - the
  46328 - clock
  46329 - under
  46330 - his
  46331 - feet
  46332 - The
  46333 - manacles
  46334 - shrieked
  46335 - like
  46336 - train
  46337 - wheels
  46338 - locked
  46339 - and
  46340 - sliding
  46341 - on
  46342 - wet
  46343 - rails
  46344 - and
  46345 - fought
  46346 - against
  46347 - him
  46348 - Arthur
  46349 - focused
  46350 - all
  46351 - his
  46352 - will
  46353 - concentrated
  46354 - all
  46355 - his
  46356 - power
  46357 - and
  46358 - spoke
  46359 - again
  46360 - Release
  46361 - me
  46362 - ”
  46363 - One
  46364 - manacle
  46365 - popped
  46366 - open
  46367 - and
  46368 - fell
  46369 - to
  46370 - the
  46371 - clock
  46372 - but
  46373 - the
  46374 - other
  46375 - though
  46376 - it
  46377 - spun
  46378 - around
  46379 - and
  46380 - writhed
  46381 - under
  46382 - his
  46383 - glare
  46384 - did
  46385 - not
  46386 - open
  46387 - Arthur
  46388 - howled
  46389 - in
  46390 - frustration
  46391 - and
  46392 - hit
  46393 - it
  46394 - with
  46395 - the
  46396 - Sixth
  46397 - Key
  46398 - shouting
  46399 - for
  46400 - the
  46401 - third
  46402 - time
  46403 - Release
  46404 - me
  46405 - ”
  46406 - The
  46407 - manacle
  46408 - exploded
  46409 - into
  46410 - droplets
  46411 - of
  46412 - molten
  46413 - steel
  46414 - that
  46415 - sprayed
  46416 - the
  46417 - lawn
  46418 - beyond
  46419 - the
  46420 - clock
  46421 - Arthur
  46422 - dropped
  46423 - to
  46424 - his
  46425 - knees
  46426 - gasping
  46427 - for
  46428 - breath
  46429 - totally
  46430 - exhausted
  46431 - by
  46432 - the
  46433 - struggle
  46434 - But
  46435 - he
  46436 - only
  46437 - had
  46438 - a
  46439 - second
  46440 - before
  46441 - the
  46442 - trapdoor
  46443 - suddenly
  46444 - sprang
  46445 - open
  46446 - and
  46447 - the
  46448 - woodchopper
  46449 - puppet
  46450 - vaulted
  46451 - out
  46452 - swinging
  46453 - his
  46454 - axe
  46455 - at
  46456 - the
  46457 - boy
  46458 - Without
  46459 - thinking
  46460 - Arthur
  46461 - blocked
  46462 - the
  46463 - blow
  46464 - by
  46465 - grabbing
  46466 - the
  46467 - puppet‘s
  46468 - forearm
  46469 - in
  46470 - the
  46471 - process
  46472 - dropping
  46473 - the
  46474 - Fifth
  46475 - Key
  46476 - He
  46477 - tried
  46478 - to
  46479 - wrest
  46480 - the
  46481 - axe
  46482 - away
  46483 - but
  46484 - the
  46485 - puppet
  46486 - was
  46487 - unnaturally
  46488 - strong
  46489 - as
  46490 - strong
  46491 - as
  46492 - Arthur
  46493 - himself
  46494 - and
  46495 - the
  46496 - axe
  46497 - was
  46498 - actually
  46499 - part
  46500 - of
  46501 - its
  46502 - arm
  46503 - Its
  46504 - wooden
  46505 - teeth
  46506 - clattered
  46507 - in
  46508 - manic
  46509 - laughter
  46510 - as
  46511 - its
  46512 - mate
  46513 - came
  46514 - out
  46515 - of
  46516 - the
  46517 - trapdoor
  46518 - and
  46519 - lunged
  46520 - at
  46521 - Arthur
  46522 - with
  46523 - an
  46524 - oversize
  46525 - corkscrew
  46526 - As
  46527 - always
  46528 - it
  46529 - aimed
  46530 - for
  46531 - his
  46532 - eyes
  46533 - Arthur
  46534 - suddenly
  46535 - let
  46536 - go
  46537 - of
  46538 - the
  46539 - woodchopper
  46540 - and
  46541 - as
  46542 - the
  46543 - creature
  46544 - stumbled
  46545 - forward
  46546 - stabbed
  46547 - him
  46548 - in
  46549 - the
  46550 - head
  46551 - with
  46552 - the
  46553 - point
  46554 - of
  46555 - the
  46556 - Sixth
  46557 - Key
  46558 - Drop
  46559 - dead
  46560 - ”
  46561 - he
  46562 - yelled
  46563 - and
  46564 - he
  46565 - felt
  46566 - a
  46567 - savage
  46568 - pain
  46569 - flow
  46570 - through
  46571 - his
  46572 - body
  46573 - and
  46574 - out
  46575 - into
  46576 - the
  46577 - puppet
  46578 - The
  46579 - woodchopper
  46580 - didn‘t
  46581 - drop
  46582 - dead
  46583 - but
  46584 - it
  46585 - fell
  46586 - back
  46587 - Arthur
  46588 - kicked
  46589 - it
  46590 - into
  46591 - the
  46592 - corkscrew
  46593 - puppet
  46594 - and
  46595 - both
  46596 - fell
  46597 - over
  46598 - Before
  46599 - they
  46600 - could
  46601 - get
  46602 - up
  46603 - Arthur
  46604 - picked
  46605 - up
  46606 - the
  46607 - loose
  46608 - chain
  46609 - and
  46610 - whipped
  46611 - it
  46612 - around
  46613 - their
  46614 - legs
  46615 - crossed
  46616 - it
  46617 - back
  46618 - on
  46619 - itself
  46620 - and
  46621 - then
  46622 - quickly
  46623 - wrote
  46624 - on
  46625 - a
  46626 - link
  46627 - with
  46628 - the
  46629 - Sixth
  46630 - Key
  46631 - Join
  46632 - Arthur
  46633 - said
  46634 - as
  46635 - he
  46636 - wrote
  46637 - the
  46638 - word
  46639 - The
  46640 - chain
  46641 - joined
  46642 - together
  46643 - as
  46644 - the
  46645 - puppets
  46646 - scrabbled
  46647 - desperately
  46648 - to
  46649 - get
  46650 - their
  46651 - entwined
  46652 - legs
  46653 - out
  46654 - of
  46655 - the
  46656 - loops
  46657 - of
  46658 - steel
  46659 - Tighten
  46660 - wrote
  46661 - Arthur
  46662 - and
  46663 - the
  46664 - chain
  46665 - shrank
  46666 - around
  46667 - the
  46668 - puppets‘
  46669 - legs
  46670 - so
  46671 - that
  46672 - no
  46673 - matter
  46674 - how
  46675 - they
  46676 - pulled
  46677 - and
  46678 - struggled
  46679 - they
  46680 - could
  46681 - not
  46682 - get
  46683 - free
  46684 - See
  46685 - how
  46686 - you
  46687 - like
  46688 - it
  46689 - said
  46690 - Arthur
  46691 - wearily
  46692 - He
  46693 - picked
  46694 - up
  46695 - the
  46696 - mirror
  46697 - and
  46698 - staggered
  46699 - off
  46700 - the
  46701 - clock
  46702 - The
  46703 - puppets
  46704 - rattled
  46705 - the
  46706 - chain
  46707 - angrily
  46708 - and
  46709 - glared
  46710 - after
  46711 - him
  46712 - their
  46713 - overlarge
  46714 - eyeballs
  46715 - rolling
  46716 - in
  46717 - their
  46718 - sockets
  46719 - and
  46720 - their
  46721 - teeth
  46722 - grinding
  46723 - Arthur
  46724 - took
  46725 - no
  46726 - more
  46727 - than
  46728 - a
  46729 - minute
  46730 - to
  46731 - get
  46732 - his
  46733 - breath
  46734 - and
  46735 - think
  46736 - then
  46737 - he
  46738 - raised
  46739 - his
  46740 - head
  46741 - and
  46742 - shouted
  46743 - careless
  46744 - of
  46745 - whoever
  46746 - might
  46747 - hear
  46748 - him
  46749 - I‘m
  46750 - coming
  46751 - Elephant
  46752 - ”
  46753 - Arthur
  46754 - broke
  46755 - into
  46756 - a
  46757 - run
  46758 - taking
  46759 - great
  46760 - strides
  46761 - He
  46762 - knew
  46763 - he
  46764 - had
  46765 - very
  46766 - little
  46767 - time
  46768 - before
  46769 - Lord
  46770 - Sunday
  46771 - found
  46772 - out
  46773 - his
  46774 - prisoner
  46775 - was
  46776 - free
  46777 - He
  46778 - had
  46779 - to
  46780 - find
  46781 - Elephant
  46782 - and
  46783 - the
  46784 - Will
  46785 - Next
  46786 - time
  46787 - I
  46788 - meet
  46789 - Lord
  46790 - Sunday
  46791 - things
  46792 - will
  46793 - be
  46794 - different
  46795 - Arthur
  46796 - thought
  46797 - The
  46798 - next
  46799 - terrace
  46800 - was
  46801 - similar
  46802 - to
  46803 - the
  46804 - one
  46805 - below
  46806 - a
  46807 - green
  46808 - expanse
  46809 - bordered
  46810 - by
  46811 - flowering
  46812 - shrubs
  46813 - and
  46814 - dotted
  46815 - here
  46816 - and
  46817 - there
  46818 - with
  46819 - stands
  46820 - of
  46821 - trees
  46822 - and
  46823 - other
  46824 - carefully
  46825 - arranged
  46826 - and
  46827 - unusually
  46828 - colorful
  46829 - plants
  46830 - Arthur
  46831 - ran
  46832 - through
  46833 - a
  46834 - border
  46835 - of
  46836 - chest-high
  46837 - red
  46838 - and
  46839 - pink
  46840 - azaleas
  46841 - and
  46842 - across
  46843 - the
  46844 - well-tended
  46845 - lawn
  46846 - towards
  46847 - another
  46848 - set
  46849 - of
  46850 - steps
  46851 - cut
  46852 - into
  46853 - the
  46854 - slope
  46855 - that
  46856 - led
  46857 - to
  46858 - the
  46859 - next
  46860 - terrace
  46861 - beyond
  46862 - But
  46863 - he
  46864 - was
  46865 - only
  46866 - halfway
  46867 - across
  46868 - when
  46869 - he
  46870 - heard
  46871 - the
  46872 - buzzing
  46873 - hum
  46874 - of
  46875 - a
  46876 - dragonfly
  46877 - He
  46878 - slowed
  46879 - and
  46880 - looked
  46881 - behind
  46882 - him
  46883 - Even
  46884 - as
  46885 - he
  46886 - turned
  46887 - his
  46888 - head
  46889 - he
  46890 - cried
  46891 - out
  46892 - in
  46893 - pain
  46894 - as
  46895 - he
  46896 - was
  46897 - struck
  46898 - by
  46899 - several
  46900 - arrows
  46901 - One
  46902 - went
  46903 - through
  46904 - his
  46905 - right
  46906 - arm
  46907 - and
  46908 - another
  46909 - through
  46910 - his
  46911 - chest
  46912 - The
  46913 - heads
  46914 - were
  46915 - glass
  46916 - shattering
  46917 - as
  46918 - they
  46919 - went
  46920 - in
  46921 - sending
  46922 - Nothing-poison
  46923 - into
  46924 - his
  46925 - bloodstream
  46926 - The
  46927 - archers
  46928 - were
  46929 - on
  46930 - the
  46931 - back
  46932 - of
  46933 - a
  46934 - dragonfly
  46935 - that
  46936 - was
  46937 - now
  46938 - hovering
  46939 - almost
  46940 - directly
  46941 - above
  46942 - him
  46943 - Arthur
  46944 - roared
  46945 - in
  46946 - anger
  46947 - and
  46948 - pain
  46949 - and
  46950 - raised
  46951 - the
  46952 - Fifth
  46953 - Key
  46954 - Burn
  46955 - ”
  46956 - he
  46957 - shrieked
  46958 - and
  46959 - a
  46960 - beam
  46961 - of
  46962 - intense
  46963 - light
  46964 - shot
  46965 - from
  46966 - the
  46967 - mirror
  46968 - It
  46969 - hit
  46970 - the
  46971 - dragonfly
  46972 - setting
  46973 - it
  46974 - on
  46975 - fire
  46976 - as
  46977 - it
  46978 - fell
  46979 - to
  46980 - the
  46981 - ground
  46982 - the
  46983 - legs
  46984 - and
  46985 - wings
  46986 - still
  46987 - twitching
  46988 - The
  46989 - Denizens
  46990 - aboard
  46991 - were
  46992 - crushed
  46993 - beneath
  46994 - the
  46995 - burning
  46996 - body
  46997 - of
  46998 - the
  46999 - huge
  47000 - dragonfly
  47001 - and
  47002 - though
  47003 - they
  47004 - would
  47005 - probably
  47006 - survive
  47007 - they‘d
  47008 - be
  47009 - badly
  47010 - hurt
  47011 - for
  47012 - a
  47013 - long
  47014 - long
  47015 - time
  47016 - Arthur
  47017 - only
  47018 - just
  47019 - managed
  47020 - to
  47021 - stop
  47022 - himself
  47023 - from
  47024 - firing
  47025 - more
  47026 - blasts
  47027 - Instead
  47028 - he
  47029 - checked
  47030 - his
  47031 - wounds
  47032 - ready
  47033 - to
  47034 - direct
  47035 - the
  47036 - Fifth
  47037 - Key
  47038 - to
  47039 - heal
  47040 - him
  47041 - But
  47042 - he
  47043 - didn‘t
  47044 - need
  47045 - to
  47046 - do
  47047 - anything
  47048 - Reinforced

  47050 - the
  47051 - power
  47052 - of
  47053 - the
  47054 - two
  47055 - Keys
  47056 - in
  47057 - his
  47058 - hands
  47059 - his
  47060 - own
  47061 - body
  47062 - was
  47063 - already
  47064 - fighting
  47065 - back
  47066 - against
  47067 - the
  47068 - poison
  47069 - Arthur
  47070 - watched
  47071 - in
  47072 - fascination
  47073 - as
  47074 - the
  47075 - Nothing
  47076 - was
  47077 - expelled
  47078 - back
  47079 - out
  47080 - through
  47081 - the
  47082 - holes
  47083 - in
  47084 - his
  47085 - skin
  47086 - falling
  47087 - to
  47088 - the
  47089 - ground
  47090 - and
  47091 - dissolving
  47092 - grass
  47093 - and
  47094 - earth
  47095 - as
  47096 - it
  47097 - sank
  47098 - out
  47099 - of
  47100 - sight
  47101 - Then
  47102 - his
  47103 - bronzed
  47104 - skin
  47105 - closed
  47106 - over
  47107 - leaving
  47108 - no
  47109 - scar
  47110 - or
  47111 - sign
  47112 - of
  47113 - any
  47114 - hurt
  47115 - Arthur
  47116 - scanned
  47117 - the
  47118 - sky
  47119 - but
  47120 - saw
  47121 - no
  47122 - more
  47123 - dragonflies
  47124 - Yet
  47125 - he
  47126 - felt
  47127 - something
  47128 - touch
  47129 - him
  47130 - a
  47131 - sensation
  47132 - like
  47133 - a
  47134 - hand
  47135 - suddenly
  47136 - reaching
  47137 - out
  47138 - and
  47139 - lightly
  47140 - tapping
  47141 - the
  47142 - top
  47143 - of
  47144 - his
  47145 - head
  47146 - It
  47147 - was
  47148 - Lord
  47149 - Sunday
  47150 - he
  47151 - knew
  47152 - using
  47153 - the
  47154 - Seventh
  47155 - Key
  47156 - to
  47157 - see
  47158 - what
  47159 - was
  47160 - happening
  47161 - This
  47162 - meant
  47163 - there
  47164 - was
  47165 - even
  47166 - less
  47167 - time
  47168 - than
  47169 - he‘d
  47170 - hoped
  47171 - Arthur
  47172 - started
  47173 - running
  47174 - again
  47175 - As
  47176 - he
  47177 - leaped
  47178 - up
  47179 - the
  47180 - steps
  47181 - he
  47182 - tried
  47183 - to
  47184 - remember
  47185 - how
  47186 - many
  47187 - terraces
  47188 - were
  47189 - cut
  47190 - into
  47191 - the
  47192 - hill
  47193 - and
  47194 - which
  47195 - terrace
  47196 - the
  47197 - clock
  47198 - was
  47199 - on
  47200 - But
  47201 - he
  47202 - couldn‘t
  47203 - remember
  47204 - and
  47205 - when
  47206 - he
  47207 - crested
  47208 - the
  47209 - slope
  47210 - to
  47211 - the
  47212 - next
  47213 - terrace
  47214 - he
  47215 - saw
  47216 - that
  47217 - there
  47218 - was
  47219 - at
  47220 - least
  47221 - one
  47222 - more
  47223 - and
  47224 - maybe
  47225 - another
  47226 - after
  47227 - that
  47228 - Arthur
  47229 - increased
  47230 - his
  47231 - speed
  47232 - crossing
  47233 - the
  47234 - slightly
  47235 - less
  47236 - wide
  47237 - lawn
  47238 - of
  47239 - this
  47240 - terrace
  47241 - at
  47242 - a
  47243 - speed
  47244 - that
  47245 - would
  47246 - have
  47247 - won
  47248 - him
  47249 - an
  47250 - Olympic
  47251 - gold
  47252 - medal
  47253 - in
  47254 - any
  47255 - sprint
  47256 - back
  47257 - home
  47258 - He
  47259 - was
  47260 - halfway
  47261 - up
  47262 - the
  47263 - rough
  47264 - stone
  47265 - steps
  47266 - on
  47267 - the
  47268 - other
  47269 - side
  47270 - when
  47271 - he
  47272 - ran
  47273 - into
  47274 - another
  47275 - one
  47276 - of
  47277 - Sunday‘s
  47278 - guards
  47279 - Instead
  47280 - of
  47281 - his
  47282 - feet
  47283 - meeting
  47284 - a
  47285 - step
  47286 - the
  47287 - step
  47288 - rose
  47289 - up
  47290 - to
  47291 - smash
  47292 - into
  47293 - him
  47294 - As
  47295 - he
  47296 - fell
  47297 - back
  47298 - down
  47299 - the
  47300 - hill
  47301 - Arthur
  47302 - saw
  47303 - that
  47304 - he‘d
  47305 - been
  47306 - struck
  47307 - by
  47308 - a
  47309 - cunning
  47310 - camouflaged
  47311 - worm
  47312 - or
  47313 - serpent
  47314 - one
  47315 - that
  47316 - had
  47317 - been
  47318 - disguised
  47319 - as
  47320 - the
  47321 - row
  47322 - of
  47323 - steps
  47324 - that
  47325 - extended
  47326 - up
  47327 - the
  47328 - next
  47329 - fifty
  47330 - feet
  47331 - of
  47332 - hill
  47333 - The
  47334 - huge
  47335 - rough
  47336 - stones
  47337 - were
  47338 - in
  47339 - fact
  47340 - segments
  47341 - of
  47342 - its
  47343 - body
  47344 - Now
  47345 - great
  47346 - coils
  47347 - of
  47348 - wormsnake
  47349 - were
  47350 - rolling
  47351 - down
  47352 - towards
  47353 - him
  47354 - threatening
  47355 - to
  47356 - crush
  47357 - him
  47358 - where
  47359 - he
  47360 - lay
  47361 - Arthur
  47362 - flipped
  47363 - himself
  47364 - upright
  47365 - and
  47366 - jumped
  47367 - fifteen
  47368 - feet
  47369 - in
  47370 - the
  47371 - air
  47372 - over
  47373 - the
  47374 - nearest
  47375 - coil
  47376 - just
  47377 - as
  47378 - it
  47379 - smashed
  47380 - down
  47381 - where
  47382 - he‘d
  47383 - been
  47384 - The
  47385 - moment
  47386 - he
  47387 - landed
  47388 - he
  47389 - looked
  47390 - around
  47391 - wildly
  47392 - looking
  47393 - for
  47394 - the
  47395 - thing‘s
  47396 - head
  47397 - He
  47398 - couldn‘t
  47399 - see
  47400 - it
  47401 - and
  47402 - that
  47403 - alarmed
  47404 - him
  47405 - more
  47406 - than
  47407 - the
  47408 - huge
  47409 - coils
  47410 - of
  47411 - its
  47412 - body
  47413 - They
  47414 - were
  47415 - relatively
  47416 - slow
  47417 - but
  47418 - the
  47419 - head
  47420 - might
  47421 - be
  47422 - quick
  47423 - with
  47424 - fangs
  47425 - roughly
  47426 - the
  47427 - same
  47428 - size
  47429 - as
  47430 - Arthur‘s
  47431 - body
  47432 - A
  47433 - coil
  47434 - rolled
  47435 - towards
  47436 - him
  47437 - This
  47438 - time
  47439 - Arthur
  47440 - raised
  47441 - the
  47442 - Fifth
  47443 - Key
  47444 - and
  47445 - once
  47446 - more
  47447 - thought
  47448 - of
  47449 - fiery
  47450 - light
  47451 - But
  47452 - when
  47453 - the
  47454 - focused
  47455 - light
  47456 - hit
  47457 - the
  47458 - wormsnake
  47459 - it
  47460 - was
  47461 - reflected
  47462 - in
  47463 - all
  47464 - directions
  47465 - the
  47466 - white-
  47467 - hot
  47468 - beam
  47469 - breaking
  47470 - into
  47471 - a
  47472 - scattering
  47473 - of
  47474 - rainbows
  47475 - The
  47476 - creature
  47477 - was
  47478 - barely
  47479 - scathed
  47480 - It‘s
  47481 - rock
  47482 - Arthur
  47483 - said
  47484 - to
  47485 - himself
  47486 - as
  47487 - he
  47488 - once
  47489 - again
  47490 - had
  47491 - to
  47492 - jump
  47493 - away
  47494 - Or
  47495 - crystal
  47496 - ”
  47497 - Whatever
  47498 - it
  47499 - was
  47500 - made
  47501 - of
  47502 - the
  47503 - wormsnake
  47504 - was
  47505 - also
  47506 - clever
  47507 - Though
  47508 - he
  47509 - still
  47510 - couldn‘t
  47511 - see
  47512 - its
  47513 - head
  47514 - or
  47515 - tail
  47516 - the
  47517 - coils
  47518 - were
  47519 - gathering
  47520 - around
  47521 - Arthur
  47522 - penning
  47523 - him
  47524 - in
  47525 - to
  47526 - a
  47527 - section
  47528 - of
  47529 - the
  47530 - lawn
  47531 - and
  47532 - doubling
  47533 - round
  47534 - so
  47535 - even
  47536 - with
  47537 - his
  47538 - prodigal
  47539 - strength
  47540 - he
  47541 - would
  47542 - not
  47543 - be
  47544 - able
  47545 - to
  47546 - jump
  47547 - past
  47548 - them
  47549 - Crystal
  47550 - reflects
  47551 - light
  47552 - thought
  47553 - Arthur
  47554 - But
  47555 - it
  47556 - also
  47557 - shatters
  47558 - when
  47559 - frozen
  47560 - He
  47561 - raised
  47562 - the
  47563 - Fifth
  47564 - Key
  47565 - and
  47566 - concentrated
  47567 - on
  47568 - it
  47569 - again
  47570 - imagining
  47571 - incredible
  47572 - intense
  47573 - cold
  47574 - projected
  47575 - as
  47576 - a
  47577 - ray
  47578 - of
  47579 - particles
  47580 - that
  47581 - would
  47582 - instantly
  47583 - freeze
  47584 - the
  47585 - wormsnake
  47586 - Freeze
  47587 - ”
  47588 - commanded
  47589 - Arthur
  47590 - and
  47591 - the
  47592 - Fifth
  47593 - Key
  47594 - obeyed
  47595 - sending
  47596 - a
  47597 - stream
  47598 - of
  47599 - cold
  47600 - against
  47601 - the
  47602 - wormsnake‘s
  47603 - flank
  47604 - But
  47605 - this
  47606 - too
  47607 - splashed
  47608 - over
  47609 - the
  47610 - creature
  47611 - without
  47612 - doing
  47613 - any
  47614 - apparent
  47615 - harm

  47621 - Arthur
  47622 - had
  47623 - regained
  47624 - his

  47626 - he
  47627 - suddenly
  47628 - felt
  47629 - afraid
  47630 - even
  47631 - as
  47632 - he
  47633 - readied
  47634 - the
  47635 - Sixth
  47636 - Key
  47637 - to
  47638 - use
  47639 - against

  47660 - a
  47661 - voice
  47662 - that
  47663 - he
  47664 - instinctively

  47683 - loud

  47735 - Piper‘s
  47736 - children
  47737 - stopped
  47738 - playing
  47739 - seven
  47740 - very
  47741 - different
  47742 - games
  47743 - involving

  49269 - the

  49292 - solidly

  49295 - The

  49358 - debris
  49359 - grabbed
  49360 - hold
  49361 - of

  49984 - was
  49985 - no
  49986 - answer
  49987 - Arthur
  49988 - jumped
  49989 - again
  49990 - as
  49991 - a
  49992 - length
  49993 - of
  49994 - the
  49995 - snake
  49996 - came
  49997 - crashing
  49998 - down
  49999 - This
  50000 - time
  50001 - he
  50002 - landed
  50003 - badly
  50004 - and
  50005 - slid
  50006 - along
  50007 - the
  50008 - creature‘s
  50009 - back
  50010 - almost
  50011 - falling
  50012 - into
  50013 - a
  50014 - thirty-foot-deep
  50015 - crevasse
  50016 - between
  50017 - three
  50018 - piled-
  50019 - up
  50020 - coils
  50021 - before
  50022 - he
  50023 - regained
  50024 - his
  50025 - balance
  50026 - That
  50027 - gave
  50028 - him
  50029 - a
  50030 - clue
  50031 - Arthur
  50032 - stood
  50033 - up
  50034 - carefully
  50035 - keeping
  50036 - his
  50037 - knees
  50038 - bent
  50039 - and
  50040 - his
  50041 - feet
  50042 - apart
  50043 - for
  50044 - better
  50045 - balance
  50046 - He
  50047 - looked
  50048 - along
  50049 - the
  50050 - wormsnake‘s
  50051 - undulating
  50052 - body
  50053 - and
  50054 - across
  50055 - the
  50056 - coils
  50057 - Then
  50058 - he
  50059 - began
  50060 - to
  50061 - run
  50062 - He
  50063 - ran
  50064 - around
  50065 - the
  50066 - coil
  50067 - he
  50068 - was
  50069 - on
  50070 - then
  50071 - jumped
  50072 - across
  50073 - to
  50074 - the
  50075 - next
  50076 - one
  50077 - that
  50078 - was
  50079 - slightly
  50080 - higher
  50081 - up
  50082 - and
  50083 - ran
  50084 - around
  50085 - that
  50086 - Then
  50087 - he
  50088 - jumped
  50089 - not
  50090 - quite
  50091 - as
  50092 - far
  50093 - to
  50094 - another
  50095 - till
  50096 - only
  50097 - a
  50098 - few
  50099 - minutes
  50100 - later
  50101 - he
  50102 - was
  50103 - at
  50104 - the
  50105 - top
  50106 - of
  50107 - the
  50108 - hill
  50109 - and
  50110 - he
  50111 - slid
  50112 - down
  50113 - the
  50114 - narrowing
  50115 - end
  50116 - of
  50117 - the
  50118 - wormsnake
  50119 - and
  50120 - on
  50121 - to
  50122 - the
  50123 - welcoming
  50124 - grass
  50125 - of
  50126 - the
  50127 - next
  50128 - higher
  50129 - terrace
  50130 - The
  50131 - huge
  50132 - creature
  50133 - continued
  50134 - to
  50135 - coil
  50136 - and
  50137 - writhe
  50138 - down
  50139 - the
  50140 - slope
  50141 - but
  50142 - not
  50143 - up
  50144 - it
  50145 - and
  50146 - Arthur
  50147 - was
  50148 - none
  50149 - the
  50150 - wiser
  50151 - about
  50152 - whether
  50153 - he‘d
  50154 - just
  50155 - jumped
  50156 - off
  50157 - its
  50158 - tail
  50159 - or
  50160 - its
  50161 - head
  50162 - He
  50163 - was
  50164 - grateful
  50165 - that
  50166 - in
  50167 - this
  50168 - respect
  50169 - at
  50170 - least
  50171 - it
  50172 - was
  50173 - more
  50174 - worm
  50175 - and
  50176 - less
  50177 - snake
  50178 - Once
  50179 - again
  50180 - this
  50181 - terrace
  50182 - was
  50183 - much
  50184 - the
  50185 - same
  50186 - as
  50187 - the
  50188 - last
  50189 - though
  50190 - the
  50191 - flowering
  50192 - shrubs
  50193 - were
  50194 - a
  50195 - strange
  50196 - rusty
  50197 - colour
  50198 - and
  50199 - had
  50200 - almost
  50201 - perfectly
  50202 - round
  50203 - leaves
  50204 - that
  50205 - suggested
  50206 - these
  50207 - plants
  50208 - were
  50209 - not
  50210 - from
  50211 - Earth
  50212 - Arthur
  50213 - kept
  50214 - away
  50215 - from
  50216 - them
  50217 - just
  50218 - in
  50219 - case
  50220 - they
  50221 - were
  50222 - not
  50223 - exactly
  50224 - plants
  50225 - He
  50226 - was
  50227 - also
  50228 - wary
  50229 - of
  50230 - steps
  50231 - but
  50232 - he
  50233 - couldn‘t
  50234 - see
  50235 - any
  50236 - on
  50237 - the
  50238 - slope
  50239 - ahead
  50240 - It
  50241 - was
  50242 - just
  50243 - a
  50244 - grassy
  50245 - bank
  50246 - some
  50247 - hundred
  50248 - or
  50249 - so
  50250 - feet
  50251 - tall
  50252 - steep
  50253 - enough
  50254 - that
  50255 - he
  50256 - would
  50257 - probably
  50258 - need
  50259 - to
  50260 - use
  50261 - his
  50262 - hands
  50263 - to
  50264 - help
  50265 - him
  50266 - climb
  50267 - it
  50268 - Arthur
  50269 - was
  50270 - halfway
  50271 - there
  50272 - sprinting
  50273 - across
  50274 - the
  50275 - lawn
  50276 - when
  50277 - the
  50278 - ground
  50279 - shook
  50280 - beneath
  50281 - him
  50282 - and
  50283 - then
  50284 - dropped
  50285 - away
  50286 - The
  50287 - boy
  50288 - fell
  50289 - and
  50290 - rolled
  50291 - bouncing
  50292 - around
  50293 - on
  50294 - the
  50295 - grass
  50296 - like
  50297 - a
  50298 - ping-pong
  50299 - ball
  50300 - on
  50301 - a
  50302 - table
  50303 - as
  50304 - the
  50305 - hill
  50306 - continued
  50307 - to
  50308 - shake
  50309 - When
  50310 - it
  50311 - finally
  50312 - stopped
  50313 - Arthur
  50314 - was
  50315 - lying
  50316 - flat
  50317 - on
  50318 - his
  50319 - back
  50320 - and
  50321 - all
  50322 - the
  50323 - round
  50324 - flowers
  50325 - had
  50326 - fallen
  50327 - from
  50328 - the
  50329 - shrubs
  50330 - What
  50331 - was
  50332 - that
  50333 - ”
  50334 - he
  50335 - said
  50336 - aloud
  50337 - as
  50338 - he
  50339 - got
  50340 - up
  50341 - and
  50342 - looked
  50343 - around
  50344 - Everything
  50345 - looked
  50346 - the
  50347 - same
  50348 - at
  50349 - first
  50350 - till
  50351 - he
  50352 - noticed
  50353 - there
  50354 - was
  50355 - a
  50356 - tall
  50357 - plume
  50358 - of
  50359 - smoke
  50360 - or
  50361 - dust
  50362 - in
  50363 - the
  50364 - far
  50365 - distance
  50366 - and
  50367 - that
  50368 - the
  50369 - sun
  50370 - had
  50371 - dropped
  50372 - significantly
  50373 - towards
  50374 - what
  50375 - he‘d
  50376 - arbitrarily
  50377 - decided
  50378 - was
  50379 - west
  50380 - making
  50381 - his
  50382 - shadow
  50383 - longer
  50384 - The
  50385 - Drasils
  50386 - have
  50387 - withered
  50388 - said
  50389 - Part
  50390 - Seven
  50391 - of
  50392 - the
  50393 - Will
  50394 - The
  50395 - Gardens
  50396 - have
  50397 - dropped
  50398 - and
  50399 - Saturday‘s
  50400 - tower
  50401 - has
  50402 - broken
  50403 - through
  50404 - Now
  50405 - you
  50406 - talk
  50407 - to
  50408 - me
  50409 - thought
  50410 - Arthur
  50411 - Where
  50412 - are
  50413 - you
  50414 - Do
  50415 - you
  50416 - know
  50417 - if
  50418 - Elephant
  50419 - is
  50420 - all
  50421 - right
  50422 - I
  50423 - am
  50424 - in
  50425 - the
  50426 - Elysium
  50427 - on
  50428 - the
  50429 - hill
  50430 - above
  50431 - you
  50432 - came
  50433 - the
  50434 - reply
  50435 - However
  50436 - I
  50437 - am
  50438 - locked
  50439 - in
  50440 - a
  50441 - cage
  50442 - and
  50443 - my
  50444 - ability
  50445 - to
  50446 - speak
  50447 - with
  50448 - you
  50449 - is
  50450 - constrained
  50451 - and
  50452 - erratic
  50453 - unless
  50454 - you
  50455 - are
  50456 - very
  50457 - near
  50458 - Come
  50459 - to
  50460 - me…no
  50461 - wait
  50462 - The
  50463 - Will‘s
  50464 - voice
  50465 - cut
  50466 - off
  50467 - again
  50468 - Arthur
  50469 - stared
  50470 - at
  50471 - what
  50472 - he‘d
  50473 - thought
  50474 - was
  50475 - a
  50476 - plume
  50477 - of
  50478 - smoke
  50479 - and
  50480 - narrowed
  50481 - his
  50482 - eyes
  50483 - against
  50484 - the
  50485 - glare
  50486 - of
  50487 - the
  50488 - lower
  50489 - sun
  50490 - With
  50491 - the
  50492 - smoke
  50493 - or
  50494 - dust
  50495 - or
  50496 - whatever
  50497 - it
  50498 - was
  50499 - dissipating
  50500 - he
  50501 - could
  50502 - see
  50503 - a
  50504 - little
  50505 - more
  50506 - clearly
  50507 - What
  50508 - he‘d
  50509 - thought
  50510 - was
  50511 - an
  50512 - insubstantial
  50513 - plume
  50514 - was
  50515 - clearly
  50516 - a
  50517 - solid
  50518 - object
  50519 - several
  50520 - hundred
  50521 - feet
  50522 - high
  50523 - overtopping
  50524 - the
  50525 - hedges
  50526 - and
  50527 - dominating
  50528 - the
  50529 - landscape
  50530 - of
  50531 - the
  50532 - Incomparable
  50533 - Gardens
  50534 - It
  50535 - looked
  50536 - like
  50537 - it
  50538 - was
  50539 - at
  50540 - least
  50541 - the
  50542 - top
  50543 - fifty
  50544 - or
  50545 - so
  50546 - floors
  50547 - of
  50548 - Saturday‘s
  50549 - tower
  50550 - poking
  50551 - through
  50552 - the
  50553 - underside
  50554 - of
  50555 - the
  50556 - Incomparable
  50557 - Gardens
  50558 - like
  50559 - a
  50560 - needle
  50561 - thrust
  50562 - through
  50563 - a
  50564 - cloth
  50565 - That‘ll
  50566 - give
  50567 - Sunday
  50568 - a
  50569 - headache
  50570 - thought
  50571 - Arthur
  50572 - with
  50573 - satisfaction
  50574 - Thousands
  50575 - more
  50576 - of
  50577 - Saturday‘s
  50578 - sorcerers
  50579 - swarming
  50580 - into
  50581 - the
  50582 - Gardens
  50583 - He
  50584 - turned
  50585 - to
  50586 - start
  50587 - up
  50588 - the
  50589 - slope
  50590 - to
  50591 - the
  50592 - top
  50593 - of
  50594 - the
  50595 - hill
  50596 - but
  50597 - had
  50598 - only
  50599 - taken
  50600 - one
  50601 - step
  50602 - when
  50603 - he
  50604 - heard
  50605 - the
  50606 - distant
  50607 - buzz
  50608 - of
  50609 - a
  50610 - dragonfly
  50611 - Instantly
  50612 - he
  50613 - changed
  50614 - direction
  50615 - and
  50616 - ran
  50617 - to
  50618 - the
  50619 - nearest
  50620 - tree
  50621 - He
  50622 - crouched
  50623 - down
  50624 - under
  50625 - its
  50626 - lower
  50627 - branches
  50628 - and
  50629 - scanned
  50630 - the
  50631 - sky
  50632 - The
  50633 - dragonfly
  50634 - was
  50635 - flying
  50636 - straight
  50637 - towards
  50638 - him
  50639 - with
  50640 - lots
  50641 - of
  50642 - Denizens
  50643 - on
  50644 - its
  50645 - back
  50646 - As
  50647 - it
  50648 - got
  50649 - closer
  50650 - Arthur
  50651 - lifted
  50652 - the
  50653 - Fifth
  50654 - Key
  50655 - and
  50656 - began
  50657 - to
  50658 - build
  50659 - another
  50660 - blinding
  50661 - blast
  50662 - of
  50663 - intense
  50664 - heat
  50665 - But
  50666 - just
  50667 - as
  50668 - he
  50669 - was
  50670 - about
  50671 - to
  50672 - unleash
  50673 - it
  50674 - he
  50675 - felt
  50676 - the
  50677 - force
  50678 - of
  50679 - the
  50680 - Seventh
  50681 - Key
  50682 - emanating
  50683 - from
  50684 - the
  50685 - dragonfly
  50686 - It
  50687 - was
  50688 - like
  50689 - a
  50690 - giant
  50691 - hand
  50692 - brushing
  50693 - the
  50694 - surface
  50695 - of
  50696 - the
  50697 - terrace
  50698 - the
  50699 - fingers
  50700 - feeling
  50701 - for
  50702 - something
  50703 - hidden…unseen
  50704 - fingers
  50705 - searching
  50706 - for
  50707 - him
  50708 - Instantly
  50709 - Arthur
  50710 - stopped
  50711 - trying
  50712 - to
  50713 - focus
  50714 - on
  50715 - a
  50716 - heat
  50717 - blast
  50718 - and
  50719 - instead
  50720 - called
  50721 - on
  50722 - the
  50723 - powers
  50724 - of
  50725 - both
  50726 - Keys
  50727 - he
  50728 - held
  50729 - to
  50730 - hide
  50731 - him
  50732 - from
  50733 - Lord
  50734 - Sunday
  50735 - He
  50736 - felt
  50737 - no
  50738 - answer
  50739 - from
  50740 - the
  50741 - Fifth
  50742 - Key
  50743 - but
  50744 - arthritic
  50745 - pain
  50746 - flashed
  50747 - through
  50748 - the
  50749 - knuckles
  50750 - of
  50751 - his
  50752 - right
  50753 - hand
  50754 - and
  50755 - without
  50756 - his
  50757 - conscious
  50758 - direction
  50759 - the
  50760 - Sixth
  50761 - Key
  50762 - suddenly
  50763 - began
  50764 - to
  50765 - sketch
  50766 - something
  50767 - in
  50768 - the
  50769 - air
  50770 - around
  50771 - Arthur
  50772 - making
  50773 - his
  50774 - hand
  50775 - dart
  50776 - around
  50777 - like
  50778 - a
  50779 - swallow
  50780 - chasing
  50781 - flying
  50782 - insects
  50783 - It
  50784 - left
  50785 - behind
  50786 - a
  50787 - spiderweb-thin
  50788 - trail
  50789 - of
  50790 - pale
  50791 - green
  50792 - ink
  50793 - that
  50794 - hung
  50795 - in
  50796 - the
  50797 - air
  50798 - and
  50799 - did
  50800 - not
  50801 - dissipate
  50802 - Within
  50803 - a
  50804 - few
  50805 - seconds
  50806 - the
  50807 - Sixth
  50808 - Key
  50809 - had
  50810 - drawn
  50811 - a
  50812 - russet-colored
  50813 - plant
  50814 - with
  50815 - broad
  50816 - sheltering
  50817 - leaves
  50818 - around
  50819 - the
  50820 - crouched-down
  50821 - Arthur
  50822 - exactly
  50823 - like
  50824 - all
  50825 - the
  50826 - other
  50827 - ones
  50828 - along
  50829 - the
  50830 - border
  50831 - of
  50832 - the
  50833 - lawn
  50834 - From
  50835 - inside
  50836 - it
  50837 - looked
  50838 - to
  50839 - Arthur
  50840 - just
  50841 - like
  50842 - a
  50843 - three-dimensional
  50844 - open
  50845 - sketch
  50846 - that
  50847 - wouldn‘t
  50848 - fool
  50849 - anyone
  50850 - for
  50851 - a
  50852 - second
  50853 - but
  50854 - he
  50855 - hoped
  50856 - that
  50857 - from
  50858 - the
  50859 - outside
  50860 - he
  50861 - was
  50862 - now
  50863 - effectively
  50864 - camouflaged
  50865 - as
  50866 - a
  50867 - plant
  50868 - and
  50869 - that
  50870 - it
  50871 - would
  50872 - resist
  50873 - at
  50874 - least
  50875 - the
  50876 - long-distance
  50877 - search
  50878 - of
  50879 - Lord
  50880 - Sunday
  50881 - The
  50882 - dragonfly
  50883 - flew
  50884 - overhead
  50885 - and
  50886 - hovered
  50887 - above
  50888 - the
  50889 - crest
  50890 - of
  50891 - the
  50892 - hill
  50893 - Arthur
  50894 - watched
  50895 - hardly
  50896 - daring
  50897 - to
  50898 - breathe
  50899 - as
  50900 - the
  50901 - ladder
  50902 - rolled
  50903 - down
  50904 - and
  50905 - Sunday
  50906 - and
  50907 - his
  50908 - Noon
  50909 - and
  50910 - Dawn
  50911 - descended
  50912 - and
  50913 - disappeared
  50914 - from
  50915 - sight
  50916 - Stay
  50917 - hidden
  50918 - said
  50919 - the
  50920 - Will
  50921 - suddenly
  50922 - back
  50923 - in
  50924 - his
  50925 - head
  50926 - Stay—
  50927 - CHAPTER
  50928 - TWENTY-TWO
  50929 - A
  50930 - thick
  50931 - cloud
  50932 - of
  50933 - Nothing-powder
  50934 - smoke
  50935 - blew
  50936 - across
  50937 - Leaf
  50938 - making
  50939 - her
  50940 - cough
  50941 - and
  50942 - her
  50943 - eyes
  50944 - smart
  50945 - A
  50946 - Newnith
  50947 - burst
  50948 - out
  50949 - of
  50950 - the
  50951 - smoke
  50952 - her
  50953 - two-handed
  50954 - sword
  50955 - raised
  50956 - above
  50957 - her
  50958 - head
  50959 - Leaf
  50960 - ducked
  50961 - aside
  50962 - and
  50963 - skewered
  50964 - her
  50965 - with
  50966 - the
  50967 - Lieutenant
  50968 - Keeper‘s
  50969 - sword
  50970 - but
  50971 - the
  50972 - blade
  50973 - skittered
  50974 - across
  50975 - the
  50976 - Newnith‘s
  50977 - armor
  50978 - as
  50979 - she
  50980 - lumbered
  50981 - past
  50982 - and
  50983 - was
  50984 - gone
  50985 - into
  50986 - the
  50987 - smoke
  50988 - with
  50989 - more
  50990 - of
  50991 - the
  50992 - enemy
  50993 - charging
  50994 - in
  50995 - behind
  50996 - her
  50997 - Leaf
  50998 - backed
  50999 - up
  51000 - against
  51001 - the
  51002 - beastwort
  51003 - who
  51004 - was
  51005 - emitting
  51006 - high-pitched
  51007 - sonic
  51008 - squeaks
  51009 - of
  51010 - either
  51011 - excitement
  51012 - or
  51013 - anger
  51014 - as
  51015 - her
  51016 - tentacles
  51017 - lashed
  51018 - about
  51019 - knocking
  51020 - the
  51021 - Newniths
  51022 - away
  51023 - from
  51024 - her
  51025 - mistress
  51026 - But
  51027 - there
  51028 - were
  51029 - so
  51030 - many
  51031 - of
  51032 - the
  51033 - enemy
  51034 - and
  51035 - the
  51036 - Piper‘s
  51037 - children
  51038 - now
  51039 - so
  51040 - spread
  51041 - out
  51042 - that
  51043 - Leaf
  51044 - had
  51045 - to
  51046 - fight
  51047 - desperately
  51048 - herself
  51049 - her
  51050 - wrist
  51051 - elbow
  51052 - and
  51053 - shoulder
  51054 - burning
  51055 - with
  51056 - pain
  51057 - as
  51058 - the
  51059 - sword
  51060 - performed
  51061 - incredible
  51062 - maneuvers
  51063 - that
  51064 - her
  51065 - joints
  51066 - and
  51067 - muscles
  51068 - simply
  51069 - couldn‘t
  51070 - cope
  51071 - with
  51072 - Not
  51073 - running
  51074 - away
  51075 - was
  51076 - possibly
  51077 - my
  51078 - dumbest
  51079 - move
  51080 - yet
  51081 - thought
  51082 - Leaf
  51083 - as
  51084 - she
  51085 - was
  51086 - saved
  51087 - at
  51088 - the
  51089 - last
  51090 - instant
  51091 - by
  51092 - a
  51093 - combination
  51094 - of
  51095 - the
  51096 - sword
  51097 - and
  51098 - one
  51099 - of
  51100 - Daisy‘s
  51101 - tentacles
  51102 - the
  51103 - former
  51104 - deflecting
  51105 - a
  51106 - thrown
  51107 - spear
  51108 - while
  51109 - the
  51110 - latter
  51111 - swept
  51112 - a
  51113 - Newnith
  51114 - off
  51115 - his
  51116 - feet
  51117 - into
  51118 - the
  51119 - remnants
  51120 - of
  51121 - a
  51122 - desk
  51123 - Maybe
  51124 - only
  51125 - slightly
  51126 - dumber
  51127 - than
  51128 - going
  51129 - to
  51130 - see
  51131 - Arthur
  51132 - in
  51133 - the
  51134 - hospital
  51135 - in
  51136 - the
  51137 - first
  51138 - place
  51139 - If
  51140 - I‘d
  51141 - stayed
  51142 - away
  51143 - I
  51144 - might
  51145 - still
  51146 - be
  51147 - at
  51148 - home
  51149 - and
  51150 - so
  51151 - might
  51152 - Aunt
  51153 - Mango
  51154 - and
  51155 - I‘d
  51156 - know
  51157 - the
  51158 - rest
  51159 - of
  51160 - my
  51161 - family
  51162 - was
  51163 - OK—
  51164 - Leaf
  51165 - dodged
  51166 - another
  51167 - wild
  51168 - sword
  51169 - swing
  51170 - fell
  51171 - to
  51172 - the
  51173 - floor
  51174 - jabbed
  51175 - the
  51176 - attacking
  51177 - Newnith
  51178 - in
  51179 - the
  51180 - leg
  51181 - and
  51182 - sprang
  51183 - up
  51184 - again
  51185 - –
  51186 - right
  51187 - into
  51188 - the
  51189 - path
  51190 - of
  51191 - a
  51192 - flung
  51193 - spear
  51194 - It
  51195 - struck
  51196 - her
  51197 - in
  51198 - the
  51199 - right
  51200 - shoulder
  51201 - and
  51202 - exploded
  51203 - in
  51204 - a
  51205 - shower
  51206 - of
  51207 - white-hot
  51208 - sparks
  51209 - Leaf
  51210 - was
  51211 - thrown
  51212 - to
  51213 - the
  51214 - ground
  51215 - her
  51216 - breath
  51217 - and
  51218 - most
  51219 - of
  51220 - her
  51221 - senses
  51222 - knocked
  51223 - out
  51224 - of
  51225 - her
  51226 - She
  51227 - didn‘t
  51228 - even
  51229 - know
  51230 - what
  51231 - had
  51232 - happened
  51233 - except
  51234 - she
  51235 - couldn‘t
  51236 - get
  51237 - up
  51238 - and
  51239 - her
  51240 - left
  51241 - arm
  51242 - either
  51243 - wasn‘t
  51244 - working
  51245 - properly
  51246 - –
  51247 - or
  51248 - maybe
  51249 - it
  51250 - wasn‘t
  51251 - there
  51252 - at
  51253 - all
  51254 - Somehow
  51255 - she
  51256 - managed
  51257 - to
  51258 - raise
  51259 - and
  51260 - turn
  51261 - her
  51262 - head
  51263 - just
  51264 - enough
  51265 - to
  51266 - see
  51267 - that
  51268 - her
  51269 - arm
  51270 - was
  51271 - indeed
  51272 - still
  51273 - there
  51274 - though
  51275 - she
  51276 - couldn‘t
  51277 - feel
  51278 - it
  51279 - The
  51280 - Lieutenant
  51281 - Keeper‘s
  51282 - coat
  51283 - had
  51284 - turned
  51285 - the
  51286 - spear
  51287 - but
  51288 - there
  51289 - were
  51290 - scorch
  51291 - marks
  51292 - all
  51293 - down
  51294 - the
  51295 - left
  51296 - side
  51297 - Leaf
  51298 - tried
  51299 - to
  51300 - sit
  51301 - up
  51302 - a
  51303 - bit
  51304 - more
  51305 - and
  51306 - as
  51307 - she
  51308 - did
  51309 - she
  51310 - felt
  51311 - something
  51312 - grating
  51313 - inside
  51314 - her
  51315 - shoulder
  51316 - accompanied
  51317 - by
  51318 - the
  51319 - awful
  51320 - nausea-inducing
  51321 - sensation
  51322 - of
  51323 - having
  51324 - broken
  51325 - bones
  51326 - Leaf
  51327 - lay
  51328 - back
  51329 - gasping
  51330 - A
  51331 - Newnith
  51332 - jumped
  51333 - over
  51334 - her
  51335 - and
  51336 - she
  51337 - flinched
  51338 - the
  51339 - pain
  51340 - from
  51341 - that
  51342 - movement
  51343 - making
  51344 - her
  51345 - black
  51346 - out
  51347 - for
  51348 - a
  51349 - second
  51350 - maybe
  51351 - more
  51352 - She
  51353 - came
  51354 - swimming
  51355 - back
  51356 - to
  51357 - consciousness
  51358 - and
  51359 - looked
  51360 - at
  51361 - her
  51362 - arm
  51363 - again
  51364 - She
  51365 - could
  51366 - feel
  51367 - her
  51368 - fingers
  51369 - now
  51370 - but
  51371 - they
  51372 - wouldn‘t
  51373 - obey
  51374 - her
  51375 - There
  51376 - was
  51377 - also
  51378 - something
  51379 - else
  51380 - wrong
  51381 - something
  51382 - that
  51383 - it
  51384 - took
  51385 - her
  51386 - a
  51387 - long
  51388 - time
  51389 - to
  51390 - process
  51391 - I
  51392 - had
  51393 - something
  51394 - in
  51395 - my
  51396 - hand
  51397 - thought
  51398 - Leaf
  51399 - woozily
  51400 - I
  51401 - had
  51402 - a
  51403 - hold
  51404 - of
  51405 - something
  51406 - important…
  51407 - There
  51408 - was
  51409 - only
  51410 - a
  51411 - broken
  51412 - piece
  51413 - of
  51414 - leather
  51415 - near
  51416 - Leaf‘s
  51417 - hand
  51418 - She
  51419 - no
  51420 - longer
  51421 - had
  51422 - Daisy‘s
  51423 - leash
  51424 - She
  51425 - no
  51426 - longer
  51427 - controlled
  51428 - the
  51429 - beastwort
  51430 - That
  51431 - thought
  51432 - had
  51433 - barely
  51434 - registered
  51435 - when
  51436 - one
  51437 - of
  51438 - Daisy‘s
  51439 - tentacles
  51440 - suddenly
  51441 - appeared
  51442 - in
  51443 - Leaf‘s
  51444 - vision
  51445 - heading
  51446 - straight
  51447 - for
  51448 - her
  51449 - The
  51450 - tentacle
  51451 - hit
  51452 - the
  51453 - floor
  51454 - near
  51455 - her
  51456 - with
  51457 - a
  51458 - crack
  51459 - slid
  51460 - back
  51461 - curled
  51462 - around
  51463 - her
  51464 - and
  51465 - lifted
  51466 - her
  51467 - into
  51468 - the
  51469 - air
  51470 - Leaf
  51471 - screamed
  51472 - as
  51473 - her
  51474 - shoulder
  51475 - moved
  51476 - Then
  51477 - once
  51478 - again
  51479 - she
  51480 - blacked
  51481 - out
  51482 - When
  51483 - Leaf
  51484 - came
  51485 - to
  51486 - the
  51487 - tentacle
  51488 - was
  51489 - still
  51490 - wrapped
  51491 - round
  51492 - her
  51493 - but
  51494 - there
  51495 - was
  51496 - also
  51497 - something
  51498 - else
  51499 - supporting
  51500 - her
  51501 - back
  51502 - so
  51503 - she
  51504 - couldn‘t
  51505 - move
  51506 - and
  51507 - this
  51508 - made
  51509 - the
  51510 - pain
  51511 - in
  51512 - her
  51513 - shoulder
  51514 - almost
  51515 - bearable
  51516 - It
  51517 - was
  51518 - also
  51519 - quiet
  51520 - around
  51521 - her
  51522 - The
  51523 - shouting
  51524 - and
  51525 - tumult
  51526 - of
  51527 - battle
  51528 - the
  51529 - crash
  51530 - of
  51531 - Nothing-powder
  51532 - weapons
  51533 - and
  51534 - the
  51535 - sizzle
  51536 - of
  51537 - lightning-charged
  51538 - spears
  51539 - and
  51540 - swords
  51541 - had
  51542 - gone
  51543 - I‘ve
  51544 - gone
  51545 - completely
  51546 - deaf
  51547 - thought
  51548 - Leaf
  51549 - And
  51550 - Daisy‘s
  51551 - going
  51552 - to
  51553 - kill
  51554 - me
  51555 - as
  51556 - well
  51557 - For
  51558 - some
  51559 - reason
  51560 - this
  51561 - made
  51562 - her
  51563 - laugh
  51564 - a
  51565 - strange
  51566 - hysterical
  51567 - laugh
  51568 - that
  51569 - she
  51570 - cut
  51571 - off
  51572 - as
  51573 - soon
  51574 - as
  51575 - she
  51576 - realized
  51577 - she
  51578 - could
  51579 - hear
  51580 - it
  51581 - though
  51582 - it
  51583 - was
  51584 - muffled
  51585 - and
  51586 - sounded
  51587 - like
  51588 - it
  51589 - came
  51590 - from
  51591 - far
  51592 - away
  51593 - So
  51594 - I‘m
  51595 - not
  51596 - deaf
  51597 - Leaf
  51598 - turned
  51599 - her
  51600 - head
  51601 - a
  51602 - little
  51603 - and
  51604 - saw
  51605 - that
  51606 - she
  51607 - was
  51608 - lying
  51609 - on
  51610 - Daisy‘s
  51611 - back
  51612 - securely
  51613 - held
  51614 - down
  51615 - by
  51616 - a
  51617 - tentacle
  51618 - just
  51619 - near
  51620 - the
  51621 - beastwort‘s
  51622 - strange
  51623 - flower
  51624 - head
  51625 - A
  51626 - petal
  51627 - twisted
  51628 - towards
  51629 - her
  51630 - as
  51631 - if
  51632 - checking
  51633 - on
  51634 - her
  51635 - condition
  51636 - And
  51637 - I
  51638 - guess
  51639 - Daisy
  51640 - isn‘t
  51641 - going
  51642 - to
  51643 - kill
  51644 - me
  51645 - Leaf
  51646 - turned
  51647 - her
  51648 - head
  51649 - to
  51650 - the
  51651 - other
  51652 - side
  51653 - In
  51654 - a
  51655 - dopey
  51656 - way
  51657 - she
  51658 - was
  51659 - surprised
  51660 - to
  51661 - see
  51662 - Suzy
  51663 - and
  51664 - Dr
  51665 - Scamandros
  51666 - standing
  51667 - near
  51668 - a
  51669 - blazing
  51670 - fire
  51671 - made
  51672 - of
  51673 - wrecked
  51674 - desks
  51675 - looking
  51676 - back
  51677 - at
  51678 - her
  51679 - Some
  51680 - thirty
  51681 - or
  51682 - so
  51683 - Piper‘s
  51684 - children
  51685 - were
  51686 - sitting
  51687 - around
  51688 - the
  51689 - fire
  51690 - toasting
  51691 - marshmallows
  51692 - a
  51693 - process
  51694 - that
  51695 - required
  51696 - constant
  51697 - movement
  51698 - as
  51699 - the
  51700 - smoke
  51701 - kept
  51702 - changing
  51703 - direction
  51704 - to
  51705 - blow
  51706 - horizontally
  51707 - towards
  51708 - different
  51709 - sides
  51710 - of
  51711 - the
  51712 - tower
  51713 - Beyond
  51714 - the
  51715 - fire
  51716 - there
  51717 - were
  51718 - lots
  51719 - of
  51720 - Denizen
  51721 - soldiers
  51722 - As
  51723 - Leaf
  51724 - watched
  51725 - them
  51726 - march
  51727 - out
  51728 - of
  51729 - numerous
  51730 - elevators
  51731 - more
  51732 - sound
  51733 - slowly
  51734 - leaked
  51735 - back
  51736 - into
  51737 - her
  51738 - ears
  51739 - She
  51740 - could
  51741 - hear
  51742 - their
  51743 - drums
  51744 - and
  51745 - fifes
  51746 - bagpipes
  51747 - and
  51748 - rababs
  51749 - and
  51750 - the
  51751 - bellowing
  51752 - orders
  51753 - of
  51754 - the
  51755 - NCOs
  51756 - Over
  51757 - the
  51758 - top
  51759 - of
  51760 - this
  51761 - background
  51762 - noise
  51763 - and
  51764 - closer
  51765 - there
  51766 - was
  51767 - something
  51768 - else
  51769 - Leaf
  51770 - looked
  51771 - at
  51772 - Suzy
  51773 - and
  51774 - saw
  51775 - her
  51776 - mouth
  51777 - move
  51778 - A
  51779 - few
  51780 - seconds
  51781 - later
  51782 - she
  51783 - matched
  51784 - these
  51785 - movements
  51786 - to
  51787 - the
  51788 - sounds
  51789 - she
  51790 - was
  51791 - hearing

  51794 - your

  51810 - something

  51818 - Suzy
  51819 - stopped
  51820 - shouting
  51821 - and
  51822 - said
  51823 - something
  51824 - to
  51825 - Dr
  51826 - Scamandros
  51827 - who
  51828 - shrugged
  51829 - Leaf
  51830 - stared
  51831 - at
  51832 - them
  51833 - for
  51834 - some
  51835 - time
  51836 - before
  51837 - it
  51838 - finally
  51839 - percolated
  51840 - through
  51841 - that
  51842 - she
  51843 - had
  51844 - to
  51845 - do
  51846 - something
  51847 - herself
  51848 - Uh
  51849 - Daisy
  51850 - she
  51851 - began
  51852 - Then
  51853 - she
  51854 - stopped
  51855 - remembering
  51856 - that
  51857 - she
  51858 - no
  51859 - longer
  51860 - held
  51861 - the
  51862 - lead
  51863 - Daisy
  51864 - wasn‘t
  51865 - under
  51866 - her
  51867 - control
  51868 - any
  51869 - more
  51870 - Two
  51871 - more
  51872 - petals
  51873 - tilted
  51874 - down
  51875 - towards
  51876 - her
  51877 - paying
  51878 - attention
  51879 - Um
  51880 - Daisy

  51882 - you
  51883 - wouldn‘t
  51884 - mind
  51885 - croaked
  51886 - Leaf
  51887 - could
  51888 - you
  51889 - put
  51890 - me
  51891 - down
  51892 - and
  51893 - let
  51894 - Dr
  51895 - Scamandros
  51896 - come
  51897 - and
  51898 - help
  51899 - me

  51901 - hurt

  51903 - The
  51904 - petals
  51905 - shivered
  51906 - and
  51907 - undulated
  51908 - but
  51909 - Leaf
  51910 - didn‘t
  51911 - know
  51912 - what
  51913 - that
  51914 - meant
  51915 - Please
  51916 - she
  51917 - said
  51918 - wearily
  51919 - and
  51920 - shut
  51921 - her
  51922 - eyes
  51923 - She
  51924 - opened
  51925 - them
  51926 - again
  51927 - a
  51928 - moment
  51929 - later
  51930 - and
  51931 - bit
  51932 - back
  51933 - a
  51934 - scream
  51935 - as
  51936 - Daisy
  51937 - lifted
  51938 - her
  51939 - up
  51940 - and
  51941 - gently
  51942 - deposited
  51943 - her
  51944 - thirty
  51945 - feet
  51946 - away
  51947 - all
  51948 - three
  51949 - of
  51950 - her
  51951 - tentacles
  51952 - hovering
  51953 - nearby
  51954 - in
  51955 - a
  51956 - protective
  51957 - manner
  51958 - Dr
  51959 - Scamandros
  51960 - rushed
  51961 - over
  51962 - and
  51963 - knelt
  51964 - by
  51965 - her
  51966 - side
  51967 - Dear
  51968 - me
  51969 - dear
  51970 - me

  51972 - said
  51973 - The
  51974 - tattoos
  51975 - on
  51976 - his
  51977 - face
  51978 - were
  51979 - of
  51980 - a
  51981 - grovelling
  51982 - rabbit
  51983 - that
  51984 - got

  52028 - answer

  52030 - was
  52031 - busy
  52032 - writing
  52033 - something
  52034 - on
  52035 - Leaf‘s
  52036 - forehead
  52037 - with
  52038 - a
  52039 - long
  52040 - white
  52041 - feather

  52044 - tickled
  52045 - and
  52046 - Leaf
  52047 - wondered
  52048 - why
  52049 - she
  52050 - was
  52051 - unable
  52052 - to
  52053 - laugh
  52054 - It
  52055 - was
  52056 - also
  52057 - deadening
  52058 - the
  52059 - pain
  52060 - which
  52061 - was
  52062 - welcome
  52063 - though
  52064 - at
  52065 - the
  52066 - same
  52067 - time
  52068 - she
  52069 - was
  52070 - beginning
  52071 - to
  52072 - feel
  52073 - very
  52074 - sleepy

  52086 - Yes

  52090 - well
  52091 - soothed
  52092 - Scamandros
  52093 - He
  52094 - had
  52095 - a
  52096 - scalpel
  52097 - out
  52098 - and
  52099 - was
  52100 - cutting
  52101 - Leaf‘s
  52102 - coat
  52103 - She
  52104 - noticed
  52105 - idly
  52106 - that
  52107 - it
  52108 - was
  52109 - not
  52110 - the
  52111 - blue
  52112 - coat
  52113 - of
  52114 - the
  52115 - Lieutenant
  52116 - Keeper
  52117 - but
  52118 - her
  52119 - radiation
  52120 - suit
  52121 - again
  52122 - strangely
  52123 - bleached
  52124 - and
  52125 - tattered
  52126 - That
  52127 - made
  52128 - her
  52129 - look
  52130 - at

  52136 - her
  52137 - fingers
  52138 - were
  52139 - curled
  52140 - as
  52141 - if
  52142 - they
  52143 - still
  52144 - gripped
  52145 - a
  52146 - hilt
  52147 - the
  52148 - Lieutenant
  52149 - Keeper‘s

  52157 - sword

  52159 - whispered
  52160 - The
  52161 - world
  52162 - was
  52163 - going
  52164 - blurry
  52165 - and
  52166 - sound
  52167 - was
  52168 - starting

  52175 - a
  52176 - single
  52177 - deep

  52179 - drum
  52180 - that
  52181 - was
  52182 - unaccountably
  52183 - becoming
  52184 - louder
  52185 - even
  52186 - though

  53733 - Daisy
  53734 - quivered
  53735 - and
  53736 - stood
  53737 - up
  53738 - taller
  53739 - on
  53740 - her
  53741 - hundreds
  53742 - of
  53743 - feet
  53744 - One
  53745 - tentacle
  53746 - scooped

  53774 - back
  53775 - in
  53776 - Dr
  53777 - Scamandros‘s
  53778 - pocket
  53779 - The
  53780 - transport
  53781 - sling
  53782 - was
  53783 - rather
  53784 - like
  53785 - an
  53786 - enormous
  53787 - upside-down
  53788 - parachute
  53789 - though
  53790 - one
  53791 - made
  53792 - of

  53794 - heavy
  53795 - material

  53800 - a
  53801 - Borderer
  53802 - Wingmaster
  53803 - Leaf

  53805 - Daisy
  53806 - go
  53807 - to
  53808 - the
  53809 - middle
  53810 - of
  53811 - the
  53812 - vast
  53813 - circle
  53814 - of
  53815 - canvas
  53816 - Then
  53817 - a
  53818 - hundred
  53819 - winged
  53820 - Borderers
  53821 - picked
  53822 - up
  53823 - the
  53824 - ropes
  53825 - that
  53826 - ringed
  53827 - the
  53828 - cloth
  53829 - and
  53830 - began
  53831 - to
  53832 - hover
  53833 - as
  53834 - high
  53835 - as
  53836 - the
  53837 - ceiling
  53838 - would
  53839 - allow
  53840 - This
  53841 - is
  53842 - the
  53843 - tricky
  53844 - part

  53846 - out

  53848 - Wingmaster
  53849 - We
  53850 - can‘t
  53851 - go

  53855 - have
  53856 - to
  53857 - go
  53858 - out
  53859 - first
  53860 - so
  53861 - the
  53862 - sling‘ll
  53863 - drop
  53864 - at
  53865 - first
  53866 - Don‘t
  53867 - be
  53868 - concerned
  53869 - Admiral
  53870 - Uh
  53871 - how
  53872 - much

  53894 - I‘m
  53895 - sure
  53896 - there
  53897 - will
  53898 - be
  53899 - no

  53902 - the
  53903 - Wingmaster
  53904 - She
  53905 - somewhat
  53906 - lessened
  53907 - this
  53908 - confident
  53909 - prediction
  53910 - by
  53911 - bellowing
  53912 - to
  53913 - her
  53914 - troops
  53915 - Keep
  53916 - it
  53917 - together
  53918 - people
  53919 - Synchronization
  53920 - is
  53921 - the
  53922 - key
  53923 - to
  53924 - a
  53925 - successful
  53926 - sling
  53927 - If
  53928 - anyone
  53929 - drops
  53930 - a
  53931 - corner
  53932 - or
  53933 - lets
  53934 - our

  53936 - valuable

  53938 - important
  53939 - passengers
  53940 - slide
  53941 - out
  53942 - I
  53943 - will
  53944 - rip
  53945 - your
  53946 - wings
  53947 - from
  53948 - you
  53949 - and
  53950 - throw
  53951 - your
  53952 - miserable
  53953 - carcass
  53954 - straight
  53955 - down
  53956 - so

  53958 - Nothing

  53978 - help
  53979 - then

  53982 - asked
  53983 - Suzy
  53984 - She
  53985 - and
  53986 - her
  53987 - Raiders
  53988 - all
  53989 - equipped
  53990 - with
  53991 - glowing

  53993 - wings
  53994 - of
  53995 - the
  53996 - highest
  53997 - quality

  53999 - also
  54000 - ready
  54001 - to

  54005 - sling
  54006 - No

  54008 - you
  54009 - General
  54010 - replied
  54011 - the
  54012 - Wingmaster
  54013 - This
  54014 - is
  54015 - a
  54016 - very
  54017 - specialized
  54018 - operation
  54019 - you
  54020 - understand
  54021 - ”
  54022 - She
  54023 - flew
  54024 - out
  54025 - the
  54026 - side
  54027 - of
  54028 - the
  54029 - tower
  54030 - and
  54031 - looked
  54032 - all
  54033 - around
  54034 - before
  54035 - shouting
  54036 - her
  54037 - next
  54038 - orders
  54039 - The
  54040 - Borderers
  54041 - began
  54042 - to
  54043 - fly
  54044 - out
  54045 - dragging
  54046 - the
  54047 - ropes
  54048 - and
  54049 - the
  54050 - canvas
  54051 - sling
  54052 - behind
  54053 - them
  54054 - As
  54055 - it
  54056 - neared
  54057 - the
  54058 - edge
  54059 - Leaf
  54060 - swallowed
  54061 - If
  54062 - the
  54063 - Borderers
  54064 - flying
  54065 - out
  54066 - behind
  54067 - were
  54068 - too
  54069 - slow
  54070 - she
  54071 - and
  54072 - the
  54073 - beastwort
  54074 - would
  54075 - slide
  54076 - out
  54077 - the
  54078 - back
  54079 - of
  54080 - the
  54081 - sling
  54082 - –
  54083 - and
  54084 - it
  54085 - was
  54086 - a
  54087 - very
  54088 - very
  54089 - long
  54090 - way
  54091 - down
  54092 - But
  54093 - the
  54094 - Borderers
  54095 - knew
  54096 - their
  54097 - business
  54098 - There
  54099 - was
  54100 - a
  54101 - frightening
  54102 - moment
  54103 - when
  54104 - the
  54105 - sling
  54106 - swung
  54107 - out
  54108 - and
  54109 - fell
  54110 - but
  54111 - its
  54112 - downward
  54113 - movement
  54114 - was
  54115 - almost
  54116 - immediately
  54117 - arrested
  54118 - as
  54119 - the
  54120 - slack
  54121 - was
  54122 - taken
  54123 - up
  54124 - on
  54125 - the
  54126 - ropes
  54127 - Very
  54128 - quickly
  54129 - the
  54130 - whole
  54131 - sling
  54132 - was
  54133 - rapidly
  54134 - ascending
  54135 - the
  54136 - hundred
  54137 - Denizens
  54138 - flapping
  54139 - their
  54140 - wings
  54141 - furiously
  54142 - to
  54143 - lift
  54144 - their
  54145 - burden
  54146 - Leaf
  54147 - lay
  54148 - on
  54149 - Daisy‘s
  54150 - back
  54151 - and
  54152 - looked
  54153 - up
  54154 - at
  54155 - the
  54156 - underside
  54157 - of
  54158 - the
  54159 - Incomparable
  54160 - Gardens
  54161 - It
  54162 - was
  54163 - brown
  54164 - and
  54165 - dried-out
  54166 - looking
  54167 - and
  54168 - there
  54169 - was
  54170 - an
  54171 - inverted
  54172 - forest
  54173 - of
  54174 - dead-looking
  54175 - roots
  54176 - or
  54177 - tendrils
  54178 - hanging
  54179 - down
  54180 - Above
  54181 - Leaf
  54182 - stretching
  54183 - all
  54184 - the
  54185 - way
  54186 - to
  54187 - the
  54188 - hole
  54189 - in
  54190 - the
  54191 - Gardens
  54192 - around
  54193 - the
  54194 - tower‘s
  54195 - top
  54196 - there
  54197 - were
  54198 - thousands
  54199 - and
  54200 - thousands
  54201 - of
  54202 - flying
  54203 - soldiers
  54204 - There
  54205 - were
  54206 - so
  54207 - many
  54208 - of
  54209 - them
  54210 - she
  54211 - felt
  54212 - like
  54213 - she
  54214 - was
  54215 - part
  54216 - of
  54217 - a
  54218 - giant
  54219 - swarm
  54220 - a
  54221 - tiny
  54222 - mote
  54223 - in
  54224 - a
  54225 - vast
  54226 - ascending
  54227 - cloud
  54228 - of
  54229 - avenging
  54230 - Denizens
  54231 - It
  54232 - was
  54233 - comforting
  54234 - to
  54235 - be
  54236 - a
  54237 - part
  54238 - of
  54239 - such
  54240 - a
  54241 - huge
  54242 - force
  54243 - and
  54244 - especially
  54245 - to
  54246 - not
  54247 - be
  54248 - at
  54249 - the
  54250 - forefront
  54251 - of
  54252 - it
  54253 - since
  54254 - even
  54255 - several
  54256 - thousand
  54257 - feet
  54258 - below
  54259 - the
  54260 - entrance
  54261 - hole
  54262 - to
  54263 - the
  54264 - Incomparable
  54265 - Gardens
  54266 - Leaf
  54267 - could
  54268 - hear
  54269 - the
  54270 - boom
  54271 - and
  54272 - crash
  54273 - of
  54274 - massed
  54275 - Nothing-powder
  54276 - weapons
  54277 - Battle
  54278 - had
  54279 - been
  54280 - joined
  54281 - somewhere
  54282 - above
  54283 - Suzy
  54284 - swooped
  54285 - down
  54286 - inside
  54287 - the
  54288 - sling
  54289 - ignoring
  54290 - the
  54291 - Wingmaster‘s
  54292 - shout
  54293 - to
  54294 - keep
  54295 - clear
  54296 - and
  54297 - flapping
  54298 - vigorously
  54299 - landed
  54300 - near
  54301 - Leaf
  54302 - Several
  54303 - of
  54304 - Daisy‘s
  54305 - petals
  54306 - rotated
  54307 - to
  54308 - point
  54309 - at
  54310 - her
  54311 - but
  54312 - Leaf
  54313 - patted
  54314 - the
  54315 - beastwort
  54316 - and
  54317 - no
  54318 - tentacles
  54319 - struck
  54320 - the
  54321 - new
  54322 - passenger
  54323 - ‘Ow
  54324 - are
  54325 - you

  54327 - asked
  54328 - Suzy
  54329 - I‘m
  54330 - all
  54331 - right
  54332 - said
  54333 - Leaf
  54334 - I

  54338 - all

  54355 - Suzy
  54356 - looked
  54357 - around
  54358 - and
  54359 - scratched
  54360 - her
  54361 - head
  54362 - then
  54363 - she
  54364 - said
  54365 - very
  54366 - quietly
  54367 - I
  54368 - just
  54369 - heard
  54370 - the
  54371 - lower
  54372 - two
  54373 - parts
  54374 - of
  54375 - the
  54376 - Middle

  54378 - are
  54379 - gone
  54380 - and

  54395 - up
  54396 - with
  54397 - Nothing

  54399 - dangerous
  54400 - to

  54402 - Luckily
  54403 - the

  54405 - got
  54406 - in

  54459 - Suzy‘s
  54460 - wings
  54461 - beat
  54462 - down
  54463 - and
  54464 - she
  54465 - leaped
  54466 - into
  54467 - the

  54469 - climbing
  54470 - between

  54478 - Wingmaster‘s
  54479 - shouts

  54510 - CHAPTER
  54511 - TWENTY-FOUR
  54512 - Arthur
  54513 - was
  54514 - crouched
  54515 - down
  54516 - hidden
  54517 - inside
  54518 - the
  54519 - sorcerous
  54520 - illusion
  54521 - of
  54522 - a
  54523 - shrub
  54524 - At
  54525 - least
  54526 - he
  54527 - hoped
  54528 - he
  54529 - was
  54530 - hidden
  54531 - because
  54532 - he
  54533 - thought
  54534 - there
  54535 - was
  54536 - still
  54537 - at
  54538 - least
  54539 - one
  54540 - superior
  54541 - Denizen
  54542 - on
  54543 - the
  54544 - hilltop
  54545 - above
  54546 - him
  54547 - and
  54548 - possibly
  54549 - even
  54550 - Lord
  54551 - Sunday
  54552 - himself
  54553 - The
  54554 - dragonfly
  54555 - had
  54556 - hovered
  54557 - for
  54558 - only
  54559 - five
  54560 - minutes
  54561 - long
  54562 - enough
  54563 - for
  54564 - Sunday
  54565 - and
  54566 - his
  54567 - entourage
  54568 - to
  54569 - land
  54570 - do
  54571 - whatever
  54572 - they
  54573 - did
  54574 - on
  54575 - the
  54576 - hilltop
  54577 - and
  54578 - then
  54579 - depart
  54580 - again
  54581 - But
  54582 - Arthur
  54583 - was
  54584 - pretty
  54585 - certain
  54586 - six
  54587 - passengers
  54588 - had
  54589 - got
  54590 - off
  54591 - the
  54592 - dragonfly
  54593 - and
  54594 - only
  54595 - five
  54596 - had
  54597 - re-embarked
  54598 - and
  54599 - since
  54600 - it
  54601 - was
  54602 - hard
  54603 - to
  54604 - see
  54605 - from
  54606 - the
  54607 - low
  54608 - angle
  54609 - inside
  54610 - the
  54611 - illusory
  54612 - shrub
  54613 - Arthur
  54614 - wasn‘t
  54615 - sure
  54616 - if
  54617 - the
  54618 - Trustee
  54619 - was
  54620 - one
  54621 - of
  54622 - the
  54623 - five
  54624 - He
  54625 - couldn‘t
  54626 - feel
  54627 - the
  54628 - power
  54629 - emanating
  54630 - from
  54631 - the
  54632 - Seventh
  54633 - Key
  54634 - nearby
  54635 - but
  54636 - perhaps
  54637 - Sunday
  54638 - was
  54639 - trying
  54640 - to
  54641 - hide
  54642 - his
  54643 - presence
  54644 - Or
  54645 - most
  54646 - likely
  54647 - Lord
  54648 - Sunday
  54649 - had
  54650 - flown
  54651 - off
  54652 - again
  54653 - because
  54654 - he
  54655 - would
  54656 - need
  54657 - to
  54658 - use
  54659 - the
  54660 - Seventh
  54661 - Key
  54662 - against
  54663 - the
  54664 - invaders
  54665 - particularly
  54666 - since
  54667 - Superior
  54668 - Saturday‘s
  54669 - army
  54670 - would
  54671 - have
  54672 - been
  54673 - greatly
  54674 - aided
  54675 - by
  54676 - the
  54677 - intrusion
  54678 - of
  54679 - the
  54680 - tower
  54681 - allowing
  54682 - her
  54683 - reinforcements
  54684 - to
  54685 - come
  54686 - straight
  54687 - into
  54688 - the
  54689 - Incomparable
  54690 - Gardens
  54691 - There
  54692 - was
  54693 - certainly
  54694 - fierce
  54695 - fighting
  54696 - going
  54697 - on
  54698 - because
  54699 - Arthur
  54700 - could
  54701 - hear
  54702 - the
  54703 - distant
  54704 - rumble
  54705 - of
  54706 - Nothing-powder
  54707 - explosions
  54708 - and
  54709 - he‘d
  54710 - seen
  54711 - several
  54712 - displays
  54713 - of
  54714 - something
  54715 - that
  54716 - was
  54717 - not
  54718 - quite
  54719 - chain
  54720 - lightning
  54721 - dance
  54722 - across
  54723 - the
  54724 - sky
  54725 - The
  54726 - explosions
  54727 - or
  54728 - the
  54729 - lightning
  54730 - had
  54731 - also
  54732 - started
  54733 - a
  54734 - wildfire
  54735 - in
  54736 - the
  54737 - Gardens
  54738 - There
  54739 - was
  54740 - a
  54741 - steadily
  54742 - growing
  54743 - column
  54744 - of
  54745 - grey
  54746 - and
  54747 - white
  54748 - smoke
  54749 - rising
  54750 - near
  54751 - where
  54752 - the
  54753 - tower
  54754 - had
  54755 - punched
  54756 - through
  54757 - the
  54758 - smoke
  54759 - spreading
  54760 - as
  54761 - it
  54762 - hit
  54763 - the
  54764 - ceiling-sky
  54765 - to
  54766 - form
  54767 - a
  54768 - dark
  54769 - pall
  54770 - that
  54771 - would
  54772 - soon
  54773 - block
  54774 - the
  54775 - sun
  54776 - Are
  54777 - you
  54778 - there
  54779 - Part
  54780 - Seven
  54781 - thought
  54782 - Arthur
  54783 - There
  54784 - was
  54785 - no
  54786 - answer
  54787 - Arthur
  54788 - scratched
  54789 - his
  54790 - head
  54791 - Very
  54792 - slowly
  54793 - so
  54794 - as
  54795 - not
  54796 - to
  54797 - disrupt
  54798 - his
  54799 - camouflage
  54800 - Do
  54801 - I
  54802 - risk
  54803 - going
  54804 - up
  54805 - there
  54806 - Arthur
  54807 - made
  54808 - his
  54809 - decision
  54810 - and
  54811 - stood
  54812 - up
  54813 - The
  54814 - illusory
  54815 - shrub
  54816 - grew
  54817 - taller
  54818 - and
  54819 - then
  54820 - as
  54821 - Arthur
  54822 - moved
  54823 - it
  54824 - moved
  54825 - too
  54826 - Experimentally
  54827 - Arthur
  54828 - raised
  54829 - his
  54830 - arm
  54831 - and
  54832 - the
  54833 - branch
  54834 - that
  54835 - his
  54836 - arm
  54837 - was
  54838 - inside
  54839 - moved
  54840 - with
  54841 - it
  54842 - Arthur
  54843 - thought
  54844 - about
  54845 - using
  54846 - the
  54847 - Sixth
  54848 - Key
  54849 - to
  54850 - dismiss
  54851 - the
  54852 - illusion
  54853 - but
  54854 - decided
  54855 - to
  54856 - keep
  54857 - it
  54858 - A
  54859 - moving
  54860 - shrub
  54861 - probably
  54862 - wasn‘t
  54863 - that
  54864 - out
  54865 - of
  54866 - the
  54867 - ordinary
  54868 - in
  54869 - the
  54870 - Incomparable
  54871 - Gardens
  54872 - It
  54873 - might
  54874 - help
  54875 - him
  54876 - surprise
  54877 - whoever
  54878 - was
  54879 - waiting
  54880 - on
  54881 - the
  54882 - hill
  54883 - or
  54884 - at
  54885 - least
  54886 - give
  54887 - him
  54888 - a
  54889 - few
  54890 - seconds‘
  54891 - advantage
  54892 - Carefully
  54893 - he
  54894 - began
  54895 - to
  54896 - climb
  54897 - the
  54898 - grassy
  54899 - slope
  54900 - of
  54901 - the
  54902 - hill
  54903 - There
  54904 - was
  54905 - another
  54906 - decorative
  54907 - border
  54908 - near
  54909 - the
  54910 - top
  54911 - only
  54912 - these
  54913 - were
  54914 - not
  54915 - earthly
  54916 - plants
  54917 - but
  54918 - tall
  54919 - single
  54920 - stems
  54921 - of
  54922 - extruded
  54923 - metal
  54924 - that
  54925 - ended
  54926 - in
  54927 - crystalline
  54928 - blooms
  54929 - of
  54930 - translucent
  54931 - blue
  54932 - Arthur‘s
  54933 - disguise
  54934 - would
  54935 - not
  54936 - help
  54937 - him
  54938 - when
  54939 - he
  54940 - was
  54941 - among
  54942 - those
  54943 - flowers
  54944 - so
  54945 - he
  54946 - stopped
  54947 - a
  54948 - little
  54949 - short
  54950 - of
  54951 - the
  54952 - top
  54953 - and
  54954 - crawled
  54955 - the
  54956 - last
  54957 - few
  54958 - feet
  54959 - so
  54960 - he
  54961 - could
  54962 - see
  54963 - who
  54964 - –
  54965 - or
  54966 - what
  54967 - –
  54968 - lay
  54969 - ahead
  54970 - The
  54971 - hilltop
  54972 - was
  54973 - grassed
  54974 - save
  54975 - for
  54976 - a
  54977 - small
  54978 - area
  54979 - no
  54980 - more
  54981 - than
  54982 - twenty
  54983 - feet
  54984 - square
  54985 - that
  54986 - was
  54987 - paved
  54988 - with
  54989 - pale
  54990 - golden
  54991 - stones
  54992 - A
  54993 - spring
  54994 - bubbled
  54995 - up
  54996 - nearby
  54997 - feeding
  54998 - a
  54999 - beautiful
  55000 - narrow
  55001 - stream
  55002 - that
  55003 - flowed
  55004 - around
  55005 - the
  55006 - paved
  55007 - area
  55008 - before
  55009 - winding
  55010 - its
  55011 - way
  55012 - down
  55013 - the
  55014 - other
  55015 - side
  55016 - of
  55017 - the
  55018 - hill
  55019 - There
  55020 - were
  55021 - small
  55022 - wildflowers
  55023 - scattered
  55024 - around
  55025 - the
  55026 - grass
  55027 - white
  55028 - and
  55029 - yellow
  55030 - and
  55031 - faded
  55032 - blue
  55033 - splashes
  55034 - of
  55035 - colour
  55036 - against
  55037 - the
  55038 - green
  55039 - There
  55040 - was
  55041 - a
  55042 - ten-foot-tall
  55043 - cage
  55044 - in
  55045 - the
  55046 - middle
  55047 - of
  55048 - the
  55049 - paved
  55050 - area
  55051 - a
  55052 - domed
  55053 - cage
  55054 - of
  55055 - gilded
  55056 - bars
  55057 - that
  55058 - looked
  55059 - as
  55060 - if
  55061 - it
  55062 - should
  55063 - have
  55064 - a
  55065 - bird
  55066 - in
  55067 - it
  55068 - but
  55069 - instead
  55070 - contained
  55071 - a
  55072 - gnarled
  55073 - and
  55074 - shrunken
  55075 - apple
  55076 - tree
  55077 - its
  55078 - branches
  55079 - heavy
  55080 - with
  55081 - tiny
  55082 - red
  55083 - fruit
  55084 - Next
  55085 - to
  55086 - the
  55087 - cage
  55088 - was
  55089 - a
  55090 - telescope
  55091 - on
  55092 - a
  55093 - tripod
  55094 - A
  55095 - Denizen
  55096 - was
  55097 - using
  55098 - the
  55099 - telescope
  55100 - pointing
  55101 - it
  55102 - at
  55103 - the
  55104 - distant
  55105 - fighting
  55106 - near
  55107 - the
  55108 - tower
  55109 - He
  55110 - was
  55111 - green-skinned
  55112 - and
  55113 - wore
  55114 - a
  55115 - patchwork
  55116 - coat
  55117 - of
  55118 - russet
  55119 - and
  55120 - orange
  55121 - leaves
  55122 - From
  55123 - the
  55124 - scythe
  55125 - that
  55126 - was
  55127 - propped
  55128 - close
  55129 - against
  55130 - the
  55131 - cage
  55132 - Arthur
  55133 - guessed
  55134 - he
  55135 - must
  55136 - be
  55137 - Sunday‘s
  55138 - Dusk
  55139 - otherwise
  55140 - known
  55141 - as
  55142 - the
  55143 - Reaper
  55144 - There
  55145 - was
  55146 - something
  55147 - else
  55148 - there
  55149 - too
  55150 - something
  55151 - that
  55152 - made
  55153 - Arthur
  55154 - feel
  55155 - a
  55156 - pain
  55157 - somewhere
  55158 - deep
  55159 - inside
  55160 - In
  55161 - front
  55162 - of
  55163 - the
  55164 - locked
  55165 - cage
  55166 - door
  55167 - there
  55168 - lay
  55169 - the
  55170 - body
  55171 - of
  55172 - a
  55173 - yellow
  55174 - elephant
  55175 - shrunken
  55176 - back
  55177 - to
  55178 - its
  55179 - original
  55180 - size
  55181 - But
  55182 - something
  55183 - about
  55184 - the
  55185 - way
  55186 - he
  55187 - lay
  55188 - told
  55189 - Arthur
  55190 - he
  55191 - had
  55192 - not
  55193 - just
  55194 - become
  55195 - a
  55196 - toy
  55197 - again
  55198 - but
  55199 - had
  55200 - been
  55201 - killed
  55202 - Elephant
  55203 - Arthur
  55204 - whispered
  55205 - to
  55206 - himself
  55207 - Then
  55208 - without
  55209 - further
  55210 - thought
  55211 - he
  55212 - charged
  55213 - drawing
  55214 - his
  55215 - two
  55216 - Keys
  55217 - as
  55218 - he
  55219 - ran
  55220 - straight
  55221 - at
  55222 - the
  55223 - Reaper
  55224 - The
  55225 - Denizen
  55226 - who
  55227 - had
  55228 - seemed
  55229 - so
  55230 - intent
  55231 - upon
  55232 - whatever
  55233 - he
  55234 - saw
  55235 - through
  55236 - the
  55237 - telescope
  55238 - turned
  55239 - in
  55240 - a
  55241 - flash
  55242 - his
  55243 - scythe
  55244 - in
  55245 - his
  55246 - hand
  55247 - Arthur
  55248 - raised
  55249 - the
  55250 - Fifth
  55251 - Key
  55252 - and
  55253 - fired
  55254 - a
  55255 - blast
  55256 - of
  55257 - heat
  55258 - and
  55259 - light
  55260 - but
  55261 - the
  55262 - Reaper
  55263 - ducked
  55264 - behind
  55265 - the
  55266 - cage
  55267 - and
  55268 - the
  55269 - Key‘s
  55270 - attack
  55271 - washed
  55272 - across
  55273 - the
  55274 - gilded
  55275 - bars
  55276 - and
  55277 - disappeared
  55278 - like
  55279 - water
  55280 - soaked
  55281 - up
  55282 - by
  55283 - a
  55284 - sponge
  55285 - Next
  55286 - Arthur
  55287 - flicked
  55288 - the
  55289 - Sixth
  55290 - Key
  55291 - while
  55292 - thinking
  55293 - dire
  55294 - thoughts
  55295 - of
  55296 - retribution
  55297 - A
  55298 - blob
  55299 - of
  55300 - Activated
  55301 - Ink
  55302 - spat
  55303 - out
  55304 - and
  55305 - shot
  55306 - towards
  55307 - the
  55308 - Reaper
  55309 - but
  55310 - again
  55311 - he
  55312 - ran
  55313 - round
  55314 - the
  55315 - cage
  55316 - and
  55317 - the
  55318 - ink
  55319 - missile
  55320 - vanished
  55321 - when
  55322 - it
  55323 - hit
  55324 - the
  55325 - bars
  55326 - I‘ll
  55327 - get
  55328 - you
  55329 - ”
  55330 - Arthur
  55331 - shouted
  55332 - He
  55333 - could
  55334 - feel
  55335 - that
  55336 - familiar
  55337 - rage
  55338 - returning
  55339 - How
  55340 - dare
  55341 - this
  55342 - green
  55343 - thing
  55344 - stand
  55345 - against
  55346 - him
  55347 - He
  55348 - ran
  55349 - around
  55350 - to
  55351 - get
  55352 - a
  55353 - clear
  55354 - shot
  55355 - at
  55356 - the
  55357 - Denizen
  55358 - but
  55359 - the
  55360 - Reaper
  55361 - was
  55362 - just
  55363 - as
  55364 - quick
  55365 - keeping
  55366 - the
  55367 - cage
  55368 - between
  55369 - himself
  55370 - and
  55371 - Arthur
  55372 - My
  55373 - Master
  55374 - will
  55375 - be
  55376 - here
  55377 - shortly
  55378 - called
  55379 - the
  55380 - Reaper
  55381 - as
  55382 - he
  55383 - crouched
  55384 - behind
  55385 - the
  55386 - cage
  55387 - to
  55388 - avoid
  55389 - another
  55390 - blast
  55391 - from
  55392 - the
  55393 - mirror
  55394 - It
  55395 - would
  55396 - be
  55397 - best
  55398 - for
  55399 - you
  55400 - your
  55401 - mother
  55402 - and
  55403 - your
  55404 - friend
  55405 - Leaf
  55406 - if
  55407 - you
  55408 - surrendered
  55409 - now
  55410 - ”
  55411 - Arthur
  55412 - stopped
  55413 - running
  55414 - and
  55415 - stood
  55416 - still
  55417 - as
  55418 - if
  55419 - he
  55420 - was
  55421 - thinking
  55422 - about
  55423 - what
  55424 - the
  55425 - Reaper
  55426 - had
  55427 - said
  55428 - But
  55429 - in
  55430 - fact
  55431 - he
  55432 - was
  55433 - thinking
  55434 - about
  55435 - how
  55436 - to
  55437 - get
  55438 - the
  55439 - Denizen
  55440 - Obviously
  55441 - they
  55442 - could
  55443 - both
  55444 - run
  55445 - around
  55446 - the
  55447 - cage
  55448 - forever
  55449 - which
  55450 - was
  55451 - evidently
  55452 - impervious
  55453 - to
  55454 - the
  55455 - Keys‘
  55456 - powers
  55457 - But
  55458 - that
  55459 - still
  55460 - left
  55461 - one
  55462 - direction
  55463 - How
  55464 - do
  55465 - I
  55466 - know—
  55467 - Arthur
  55468 - started
  55469 - to
  55470 - say
  55471 - but
  55472 - instead
  55473 - of
  55474 - continuing
  55475 - he
  55476 - jumped
  55477 - easily
  55478 - twelve
  55479 - feet
  55480 - in
  55481 - the
  55482 - air
  55483 - and
  55484 - directed
  55485 - another
  55486 - blast
  55487 - at
  55488 - the
  55489 - Reaper
  55490 - The
  55491 - Denizen
  55492 - was
  55493 - ready
  55494 - even
  55495 - for
  55496 - this
  55497 - He
  55498 - dived
  55499 - to
  55500 - the
  55501 - ground
  55502 - twisted
  55503 - round
  55504 - and
  55505 - though
  55506 - a
  55507 - little
  55508 - of
  55509 - the
  55510 - blast
  55511 - reached
  55512 - him
  55513 - most
  55514 - was
  55515 - deflected
  55516 - by
  55517 - his
  55518 - scythe
  55519 - Arthur
  55520 - landed
  55521 - lightly
  55522 - and
  55523 - ran
  55524 - clockwise
  55525 - The
  55526 - Reaper
  55527 - jumped
  55528 - up
  55529 - and
  55530 - ran
  55531 - the
  55532 - same
  55533 - way
  55534 - What
  55535 - have
  55536 - you
  55537 - done
  55538 - to
  55539 - Elephant
  55540 - And
  55541 - where
  55542 - is
  55543 - Leaf
  55544 - ”
  55545 - asked
  55546 - Arthur
  55547 - Surrender
  55548 - and
  55549 - I‘ll
  55550 - tell
  55551 - you
  55552 - said
  55553 - the
  55554 - Reaper
  55555 - Arthur
  55556 - looked
  55557 - at
  55558 - the
  55559 - cage
  55560 - If
  55561 - I
  55562 - jump
  55563 - on
  55564 - top
  55565 - of
  55566 - that
  55567 - I‘ll
  55568 - be
  55569 - able
  55570 - to
  55571 - get
  55572 - him
  55573 - he
  55574 - thought
  55575 - He
  55576 - had
  55577 - tensed
  55578 - to
  55579 - leap
  55580 - when
  55581 - the
  55582 - Will‘s
  55583 - voice
  55584 - suddenly
  55585 - burst
  55586 - into
  55587 - his
  55588 - head
  55589 - No
  55590 - Arthur
  55591 - The
  55592 - cage
  55593 - is
  55594 - death
  55595 - You
  55596 - must
  55597 - not
  55598 - touch
  55599 - the
  55600 - bars
  55601 - That
  55602 - is
  55603 - what
  55604 - happened
  55605 - to
  55606 - your
  55607 - elephant
  55608 - Arthur
  55609 - stumbled
  55610 - forward
  55611 - and
  55612 - only
  55613 - just
  55614 - managed
  55615 - to
  55616 - keep
  55617 - his
  55618 - balance
  55619 - He
  55620 - landed
  55621 - awkwardly
  55622 - his
  55623 - face
  55624 - close
  55625 - to
  55626 - the
  55627 - cage
  55628 - and
  55629 - saw
  55630 - that
  55631 - the
  55632 - apple
  55633 - tree
  55634 - was
  55635 - no
  55636 - mere
  55637 - tree
  55638 - Its
  55639 - bark
  55640 - and
  55641 - leaves
  55642 - and
  55643 - apples
  55644 - were
  55645 - all
  55646 - made
  55647 - up
  55648 - of
  55649 - tiny
  55650 - shifting
  55651 - letters
  55652 - arranged
  55653 - in
  55654 - lines
  55655 - of
  55656 - minuscule
  55657 - type
  55658 - The
  55659 - tree
  55660 - was
  55661 - Part
  55662 - Seven
  55663 - of
  55664 - the
  55665 - Will
  55666 - Arthur
  55667 - stared
  55668 - at
  55669 - it
  55670 - for
  55671 - a
  55672 - moment
  55673 - too
  55674 - long
  55675 - giving
  55676 - the
  55677 - Reaper
  55678 - his
  55679 - chance
  55680 - The
  55681 - scythe
  55682 - came
  55683 - slicing
  55684 - down
  55685 - Arthur
  55686 - saw
  55687 - its
  55688 - moving
  55689 - shadow
  55690 - and
  55691 - dodged
  55692 - but
  55693 - not
  55694 - quite
  55695 - fast
  55696 - enough
  55697 - The
  55698 - blade
  55699 - cut
  55700 - his
  55701 - arm
  55702 - from
  55703 - shoulder
  55704 - to
  55705 - wrist
  55706 - and
  55707 - he
  55708 - dropped
  55709 - the
  55710 - Sixth
  55711 - Key
  55712 - The
  55713 - pain
  55714 - was
  55715 - intense
  55716 - and
  55717 - would
  55718 - have
  55719 - incapacitated
  55720 - a
  55721 - normal
  55722 - boy
  55723 - but
  55724 - Arthur
  55725 - had
  55726 - long
  55727 - since
  55728 - learned
  55729 - to
  55730 - cope
  55731 - with
  55732 - pain
  55733 - He
  55734 - twisted
  55735 - around
  55736 - and
  55737 - fired
  55738 - a
  55739 - blast
  55740 - from
  55741 - the
  55742 - Fifth
  55743 - Key
  55744 - straight
  55745 - up
  55746 - at
  55747 - the
  55748 - Reaper
  55749 - This
  55750 - time
  55751 - he
  55752 - didn‘t
  55753 - miss
  55754 - The
  55755 - white-hot
  55756 - beam
  55757 - went
  55758 - through
  55759 - the
  55760 - coat
  55761 - of
  55762 - autumn
  55763 - leaves
  55764 - and
  55765 - the
  55766 - green
  55767 - waistcoat
  55768 - behind
  55769 - right
  55770 - through
  55771 - the
  55772 - Denizen‘s
  55773 - chest
  55774 - carving
  55775 - out
  55776 - a
  55777 - hole
  55778 - as
  55779 - wide
  55780 - as
  55781 - a
  55782 - dinner
  55783 - plate
  55784 - Ouch
  55785 - said
  55786 - the
  55787 - Reaper
  55788 - He
  55789 - staggered
  55790 - back
  55791 - a
  55792 - few
  55793 - feet
  55794 - and
  55795 - sat
  55796 - down
  55797 - What
  55798 - have
  55799 - you
  55800 - done
  55801 - with
  55802 - Leaf
  55803 - ”
  55804 - asked
  55805 - Arthur
  55806 - again
  55807 - He
  55808 - tried
  55809 - to
  55810 - pick
  55811 - up
  55812 - the
  55813 - Sixth
  55814 - Key
  55815 - but
  55816 - his
  55817 - arm
  55818 - was
  55819 - useless
  55820 - Impatiently
  55821 - he
  55822 - focused
  55823 - on
  55824 - the
  55825 - Fifth
  55826 - Key
  55827 - ordering
  55828 - it
  55829 - to
  55830 - heal
  55831 - him
  55832 - Even
  55833 - more
  55834 - pain
  55835 - lashed
  55836 - through
  55837 - his
  55838 - body
  55839 - but
  55840 - he
  55841 - gritted
  55842 - his
  55843 - teeth
  55844 - as
  55845 - the
  55846 - flesh
  55847 - rippled
  55848 - and
  55849 - reformed
  55850 - and
  55851 - in
  55852 - a
  55853 - few
  55854 - seconds
  55855 - his
  55856 - arm
  55857 - was
  55858 - whole
  55859 - Arthur
  55860 - grunted
  55861 - and
  55862 - picked
  55863 - up
  55864 - the
  55865 - quill
  55866 - pen
  55867 - The
  55868 - Reaper‘s
  55869 - scythe
  55870 - lay
  55871 - near
  55872 - the
  55873 - Denizen
  55874 - Arthur
  55875 - picked
  55876 - that
  55877 - up
  55878 - too
  55879 - and
  55880 - threw
  55881 - it
  55882 - off
  55883 - the
  55884 - hill
  55885 - It
  55886 - went
  55887 - several
  55888 - hundred
  55889 - yards
  55890 - and
  55891 - for
  55892 - a
  55893 - moment
  55894 - Arthur
  55895 - watched
  55896 - it
  55897 - and
  55898 - wished
  55899 - that
  55900 - he
  55901 - could
  55902 - have
  55903 - once
  55904 - thrown
  55905 - a
  55906 - ball
  55907 - like
  55908 - that
  55909 - But
  55910 - he
  55911 - never
  55912 - had
  55913 - and
  55914 - he
  55915 - knew
  55916 - he
  55917 - never
  55918 - would
  55919 - I
  55920 - do
  55921 - not
  55922 - have
  55923 - the
  55924 - heart
  55925 - to
  55926 - fight
  55927 - you
  55928 - now
  55929 - said
  55930 - the
  55931 - Reaper
  55932 - indicating
  55933 - his
  55934 - hollow
  55935 - cauterized
  55936 - chest
  55937 - In
  55938 - truth
  55939 - it
  55940 - was
  55941 - a
  55942 - foregone
  55943 - conclusion
  55944 - But
  55945 - I
  55946 - have
  55947 - played
  55948 - my
  55949 - part
  55950 - My
  55951 - Master
  55952 - will
  55953 - deal
  55954 - with
  55955 - you
  55956 - now
  55957 - ”
  55958 - He
  55959 - pointed
  55960 - to
  55961 - something
  55962 - in
  55963 - the
  55964 - sky
  55965 - Arthur
  55966 - followed
  55967 - his
  55968 - gaze
  55969 - There
  55970 - was
  55971 - a
  55972 - dragonfly
  55973 - approaching
  55974 - It
  55975 - was
  55976 - distant
  55977 - now
  55978 - coming
  55979 - back
  55980 - from
  55981 - the
  55982 - tower
  55983 - and
  55984 - the
  55985 - smoke
  55986 - but
  55987 - it
  55988 - would
  55989 - arrive
  55990 - in
  55991 - a
  55992 - matter
  55993 - of
  55994 - minutes
  55995 - Not
  55996 - if
  55997 - I
  55998 - have
  55999 - the
  56000 - Will
  56001 - he
  56002 - won‘t
  56003 - said
  56004 - Arthur
  56005 - He
  56006 - turned
  56007 - back
  56008 - to
  56009 - the
  56010 - cage
  56011 - and
  56012 - knelt
  56013 - down
  56014 - by
  56015 - Elephant
  56016 - Bending
  56017 - his
  56018 - head
  56019 - he
  56020 - whispered
  56021 - something
  56022 - no
  56023 - one
  56024 - else
  56025 - would
  56026 - ever
  56027 - know
  56028 - and
  56029 - picked
  56030 - up
  56031 - his
  56032 - oldest
  56033 - friend
  56034 - taking
  56035 - extra
  56036 - care
  56037 - when
  56038 - he
  56039 - drew
  56040 - the
  56041 - animal‘s
  56042 - trunk
  56043 - out
  56044 - from
  56045 - between
  56046 - the
  56047 - bars
  56048 - of
  56049 - the
  56050 - cage
  56051 - Then
  56052 - walking
  56053 - very
  56054 - slowly
  56055 - he
  56056 - took
  56057 - him
  56058 - to
  56059 - the
  56060 - spring
  56061 - and
  56062 - laid
  56063 - him
  56064 - down
  56065 - on
  56066 - the
  56067 - fresh
  56068 - green
  56069 - grass
  56070 - next
  56071 - to
  56072 - the
  56073 - clear
  56074 - water
  56075 - The
  56076 - Reaper
  56077 - watched
  56078 - him
  56079 - but
  56080 - made
  56081 - no
  56082 - move
  56083 - to
  56084 - interfere
  56085 - Arthur
  56086 - returned
  56087 - to
  56088 - the
  56089 - cage
  56090 - and
  56091 - looked
  56092 - at
  56093 - the
  56094 - rectangular
  56095 - door
  56096 - in
  56097 - the
  56098 - front
  56099 - It
  56100 - had
  56101 - a
  56102 - lock
  56103 - plate
  56104 - the
  56105 - size
  56106 - of
  56107 - a
  56108 - postage
  56109 - stamp
  56110 - with
  56111 - a
  56112 - very
  56113 - small
  56114 - keyhole
  56115 - So
  56116 - how
  56117 - do
  56118 - I
  56119 - open
  56120 - the
  56121 - cage
  56122 - and
  56123 - release
  56124 - you
  56125 - thought
  56126 - Arthur
  56127 - to
  56128 - the
  56129 - Will
  56130 - The
  56131 - Sixth
  56132 - Key
  56133 - writing
  56134 - on
  56135 - the
  56136 - lock
  56137 - No
  56138 - replied
  56139 - the
  56140 - Will
  56141 - Only
  56142 - the
  56143 - Seventh
  56144 - Key
  56145 - can
  56146 - turn
  56147 - that
  56148 - lock
  56149 - What
  56150 - ”
  56151 - exclaimed
  56152 - Arthur
  56153 - aloud
  56154 - But
  56155 - I
  56156 - can‘t
  56157 - get
  56158 - the
  56159 - Key
  56160 - unless
  56161 - you
  56162 - help
  56163 - me
  56164 - ”
  56165 - Indeed
  56166 - said
  56167 - the
  56168 - Will
  56169 - And
  56170 - I
  56171 - cannot
  56172 - help
  56173 - you
  56174 - obtain
  56175 - the
  56176 - Key
  56177 - from
  56178 - inside
  56179 - this
  56180 - cage
  56181 - However—
  56182 - I
  56183 - don‘t
  56184 - believe
  56185 - this
  56186 - thought
  56187 - Arthur
  56188 - furiously
  56189 - He
  56190 - looked
  56191 - out
  56192 - at
  56193 - the
  56194 - approaching
  56195 - dragonfly
  56196 - He
  56197 - could
  56198 - almost
  56199 - feel
  56200 - those
  56201 - sorcerous
  56202 - shackles
  56203 - again
  56204 - and
  56205 - his
  56206 - eyes
  56207 - were
  56208 - burning…
  56209 - There
  56210 - is
  56211 - always
  56212 - hope
  56213 - said
  56214 - the
  56215 - Will
  56216 - As
  56217 - I
  56218 - said
  56219 - only
  56220 - the
  56221 - Seventh
  56222 - Key
  56223 - can
  56224 - turn
  56225 - the
  56226 - lock
  56227 - but—
  56228 - An
  56229 - incredibly
  56230 - loud
  56231 - boom
  56232 - interrupted
  56233 - the
  56234 - Will
  56235 - Arthur
  56236 - was
  56237 - knocked
  56238 - to
  56239 - the
  56240 - ground
  56241 - by
  56242 - a
  56243 - shock
  56244 - wave
  56245 - that
  56246 - sent
  56247 - flowers
  56248 - and
  56249 - leaves
  56250 - flying
  56251 - bowled
  56252 - the
  56253 - telescope
  56254 - and
  56255 - tripod
  56256 - over
  56257 - and
  56258 - tumbled
  56259 - the
  56260 - Reaper
  56261 - almost
  56262 - to
  56263 - the
  56264 - edge
  56265 - of
  56266 - the
  56267 - hill
  56268 - Lying
  56269 - on
  56270 - his
  56271 - back
  56272 - Arthur
  56273 - saw
  56274 - a
  56275 - huge
  56276 - fireball
  56277 - scream
  56278 - across
  56279 - the
  56280 - sky
  56281 - A
  56282 - second
  56283 - later
  56284 - there
  56285 - was
  56286 - another
  56287 - deafening
  56288 - boom
  56289 - and
  56290 - the
  56291 - earth
  56292 - shook
  56293 - as
  56294 - the
  56295 - fireball
  56296 - hit
  56297 - the
  56298 - ground
  56299 - about
  56300 - half
  56301 - a
  56302 - mile
  56303 - away
  56304 - and
  56305 - smashed
  56306 - its
  56307 - way
  56308 - through
  56309 - a
  56310 - dozen
  56311 - or
  56312 - more
  56313 - tall
  56314 - hedges
  56315 - and
  56316 - garden
  56317 - beds
  56318 - starting
  56319 - even
  56320 - more
  56321 - fires
  56322 - What
  56323 - was
  56324 - that
  56325 - ”
  56326 - he
  56327 - exclaimed
  56328 - The
  56329 - Mariner‘s
  56330 - sun
  56331 - ship
  56332 - said
  56333 - the
  56334 - Will
  56335 - You
  56336 - must
  56337 - go
  56338 - to
  56339 - him
  56340 - and
  56341 - bring
  56342 - him
  56343 - back
  56344 - Quickly
  56345 - There
  56346 - is
  56347 - little
  56348 - time
  56349 - Arthur
  56350 - swung
  56351 - around
  56352 - The
  56353 - dragonfly
  56354 - was
  56355 - getting
  56356 - close
  56357 - But
  56358 - there
  56359 - were
  56360 - other
  56361 - dots
  56362 - in
  56363 - the
  56364 - sky
  56365 - behind
  56366 - it
  56367 - A
  56368 - great
  56369 - number
  56370 - of
  56371 - them
  56372 - You‘d
  56373 - better
  56374 - hurry
  56375 - said
  56376 - the
  56377 - Will
  56378 - This
  56379 - is
  56380 - our
  56381 - chance
  56382 - Arthur
  56383 - ignored
  56384 - it
  56385 - He
  56386 - picked
  56387 - up
  56388 - the
  56389 - telescope
  56390 - It
  56391 - was
  56392 - very
  56393 - long
  56394 - and
  56395 - heavy
  56396 - but
  56397 - he
  56398 - lined
  56399 - it
  56400 - up
  56401 - and
  56402 - held
  56403 - it
  56404 - steady
  56405 - The
  56406 - dragonfly
  56407 - had
  56408 - Lord
  56409 - Sunday
  56410 - aboard
  56411 - and
  56412 - some
  56413 - of
  56414 - the
  56415 - dots
  56416 - behind
  56417 - were
  56418 - dragonflies
  56419 - too
  56420 - but
  56421 - many
  56422 - more
  56423 - of
  56424 - them
  56425 - were
  56426 - Newniths
  56427 - with
  56428 - leather
  56429 - wings
  56430 - and
  56431 - winged

  56433 - of

  56436 - and

  56438 - The
  56439 - Newniths
  56440 - and

  56443 - were
  56444 - not
  56445 - fighting
  56446 - each
  56447 - other
  56448 - but
  56449 - were
  56450 - attacking

  56453 - together
  56454 - Saturday‘s

  56466 - Of
  56467 - course

  56470 - Will
  56471 - Without
  56472 - her
  56473 - Key
  56474 - Saturday
  56475 - would
  56476 - be
  56477 - easily
  56478 - swayed
  56479 - to
  56480 - the
  56481 - Piper‘s
  56482 - service
  56483 - As
  56484 - Arthur
  56485 - watched
  56486 - Sunday‘s
  56487 - rearguard
  56488 - was
  56489 - driven
  56490 - from
  56491 - the
  56492 - sky
  56493 - the
  56494 - dragonflies
  56495 - overwhelmed
  56496 - by
  56497 - the
  56498 - sheer
  56499 - numbers
  56500 - of
  56501 - their
  56502 - enemies
  56503 - But
  56504 - as

  56507 - and

  56509 - flew
  56510 - on
  56511 - Sunday‘s
  56512 - dragonfly
  56513 - suddenly
  56514 - turned
  56515 - back
  56516 - to

  56518 - them
  56519 - The
  56520 - Trustee

  56522 - and
  56523 - great
  56524 - arcs
  56525 - of
  56526 - lightning
  56527 - played
  56528 - across
  56529 - the
  56530 - sky
  56531 - striking
  56532 - down
  56533 - hundreds
  56534 - of
  56535 - his
  56536 - enemies
  56537 - But
  56538 - there
  56539 - were
  56540 - thousands
  56541 - perhaps
  56542 - even
  56543 - tens
  56544 - of
  56545 - thousands
  56546 - more
  56547 - Sunday
  56548 - will
  56549 - soon
  56550 - realise
  56551 - that
  56552 - battle
  56553 - is
  56554 - not
  56555 - the
  56556 - most
  56557 - important

  56566 - kept
  56567 - watching
  56568 - Sunday‘s
  56569 - lightning
  56570 - was
  56571 - the
  56572 - most
  56573 - spectacular
  56574 - but
  56575 - there
  56576 - were
  56577 - other
  56578 - things
  56579 - going
  56580 - on
  56581 - as
  56582 - well
  56583 - too
  56584 - much
  56585 - to

  58403 - the

  58456 - Aye
  58457 - said
  58458 - the
  58459 - Mariner
  58460 - I
  58461 - thought
  58462 - it

  58473 - somewhere
  58474 - sometime

  58478 - He
  58479 - gestured
  58480 - with
  58481 - the
  58482 - harpoon
  58483 - and
  58484 - his
  58485 - sailors
  58486 - marched
  58487 - forward
  58488 - following
  58489 - close
  58490 - behind
  58491 - the
  58492 - Captain
  58493 - Arthur
  58494 - thought
  58495 - two
  58496 - of
  58497 - them
  58498 - looked
  58499 - familiar
  58500 - but
  58501 - he
  58502 - had
  58503 - no
  58504 - time
  58505 - to
  58506 - waste
  58507 - figuring
  58508 - out
  58509 - who
  58510 - they
  58511 - were
  58512 - He
  58513 - turned
  58514 - around
  58515 - and
  58516 - began
  58517 - to

  58519 - again
  58520 - But
  58521 - the
  58522 - Mariner
  58523 - did
  58524 - not

  58527 - lengthened
  58528 - his

  58531 - even
  58532 - so
  58533 - Arthur
  58534 - was
  58535 - a
  58536 - dozen
  58537 - yards
  58538 - ahead
  58539 - when
  58540 - the
  58541 - boy
  58542 - looked
  58543 - back
  58544 - and
  58545 - halted
  58546 - Come
  58547 - on

  58552 - There
  58553 - will

  58562 - well-gauged

  58566 - the
  58567 - distant

  58594 - He
  58595 - lifted
  58596 - the
  58597 - harpoon
  58598 - above
  58599 - his
  58600 - head

  58602 - heard
  58603 - its
  58604 - crackling
  58605 - paper
  58606 - noise
  58607 - and
  58608 - tensed
  58609 - for
  58610 - the
  58611 - toothache
  58612 - and
  58613 - joint
  58614 - pain
  58615 - that
  58616 - would
  58617 - strike
  58618 - when
  58619 - it
  58620 - flew

  58622 - as
  58623 - the
  58624 - shaft
  58625 - of
  58626 - light
  58627 - leaped
  58628 - from
  58629 - the

  58633 - flash
  58634 - up

  58636 - hillside

  58638 - experienced
  58639 - no
  58640 - more
  58641 - than
  58642 - a
  58643 - passing
  58644 - twinge

  58668 - asked
  58669 - Arthur

  58671 - had

  58809 - me
  58810 - the
  58811 - Key
  58812 - and
  58813 - then—
  58814 - Indeed
  58815 - said
  58816 - the
  58817 - Mariner
  58818 - He
  58819 - looked
  58820 - up
  58821 - again
  58822 - Sunday‘s
  58823 - dragonfly
  58824 - was
  58825 - less
  58826 - than
  58827 - half
  58828 - a
  58829 - mile
  58830 - away
  58831 - I
  58832 - said
  58833 - we‘d
  58834 - not
  58835 - need
  58836 - to
  58837 - run—
  58838 - Yes
  58839 - ”
  58840 - I
  58841 - was
  58842 - wrong
  58843 - Swiftly
  58844 - now
  58845 - ”
  58846 - The
  58847 - Mariner
  58848 - broke
  58849 - into
  58850 - a
  58851 - sprint
  58852 - taking
  58853 - the
  58854 - worm
  58855 - snake
  58856 - steps
  58857 - three
  58858 - at
  58859 - a
  58860 - time
  58861 - Arthur
  58862 - outpaced
  58863 - him
  58864 - running
  58865 - fast
  58866 - ahead
  58867 - They
  58868 - were
  58869 - both
  58870 - on
  58871 - the
  58872 - next
  58873 - terrace
  58874 - when
  58875 - Sunday‘s
  58876 - lightning
  58877 - lashed
  58878 - down
  58879 - behind
  58880 - them
  58881 - Arthur
  58882 - was
  58883 - blinded
  58884 - for
  58885 - a
  58886 - moment
  58887 - and
  58888 - deafened
  58889 - by
  58890 - the
  58891 - crash
  58892 - of
  58893 - thunder
  58894 - that
  58895 - drowned
  58896 - out
  58897 - the
  58898 - screams
  58899 - of
  58900 - the
  58901 - sailor
  58902 - Denizens
  58903 - He
  58904 - looked
  58905 - back
  58906 - but
  58907 - could
  58908 - only
  58909 - see
  58910 - the
  58911 - Mariner
  58912 - who
  58913 - was
  58914 - himself
  58915 - looking
  58916 - back
  58917 - though
  58918 - only
  58919 - for
  58920 - a
  58921 - second
  58922 - before
  58923 - he
  58924 - began
  58925 - to
  58926 - run
  58927 - again
  58928 - Use
  58929 - your
  58930 - Keys
  58931 - to
  58932 - shield
  58933 - us
  58934 - ”
  58935 - commanded
  58936 - the
  58937 - Captain
  58938 - He
  58939 - ran
  58940 - close
  58941 - to
  58942 - Arthur
  58943 - so
  58944 - close
  58945 - their
  58946 - shoulders
  58947 - touched
  58948 - Arthur
  58949 - raised
  58950 - his
  58951 - Keys
  58952 - above
  58953 - his
  58954 - head
  58955 - as
  58956 - he
  58957 - ran
  58958 - and
  58959 - thought
  58960 - of
  58961 - shields
  58962 - He
  58963 - remembered
  58964 - illustrations
  58965 - of
  58966 - Roman
  58967 - testudos
  58968 - the
  58969 - tortoise
  58970 - formation
  58971 - and
  58972 - that
  58973 - made
  58974 - him
  58975 - think
  58976 - of
  58977 - tortoises
  58978 - themselves
  58979 - and
  58980 - their
  58981 - thick
  58982 - shells
  58983 - He
  58984 - felt
  58985 - the
  58986 - mirror
  58987 - and
  58988 - the
  58989 - pen
  58990 - twitch
  58991 - in
  58992 - his
  58993 - hands
  58994 - and
  58995 - the
  58996 - now
  58997 - familiar
  58998 - pain
  58999 - of
  59000 - sorcery
  59001 - Then
  59002 - the
  59003 - lightning
  59004 - came
  59005 - again
  59006 - and
  59007 - he
  59008 - was
  59009 - briefly
  59010 - blinded
  59011 - catching
  59012 - the
  59013 - fading
  59014 - afterimages
  59015 - of
  59016 - the
  59017 - great
  59018 - arc
  59019 - of
  59020 - electricity
  59021 - as
  59022 - it
  59023 - bounced
  59024 - off
  59025 - him
  59026 - and
  59027 - into
  59028 - the
  59029 - hill
  59030 - Three
  59031 - times
  59032 - the
  59033 - lightning
  59034 - came
  59035 - as
  59036 - they
  59037 - climbed
  59038 - the
  59039 - last
  59040 - slope
  59041 - and
  59042 - three
  59043 - times
  59044 - Arthur‘s
  59045 - shield
  59046 - deflected
  59047 - it
  59048 - But
  59049 - it
  59050 - was
  59051 - not
  59052 - without
  59053 - cost
  59054 - Arthur
  59055 - felt
  59056 - like
  59057 - he‘d
  59058 - been
  59059 - carrying
  59060 - a
  59061 - vast
  59062 - weight
  59063 - above
  59064 - his
  59065 - head
  59066 - and
  59067 - he
  59068 - could
  59069 - barely
  59070 - make
  59071 - the
  59072 - last
  59073 - ten
  59074 - feet
  59075 - to
  59076 - the
  59077 - Elysium
  59078 - and
  59079 - the
  59080 - paved
  59081 - area
  59082 - with
  59083 - its
  59084 - gilded
  59085 - cage
  59086 - He
  59087 - staggered
  59088 - and
  59089 - would
  59090 - have
  59091 - fallen
  59092 - but
  59093 - the
  59094 - Mariner
  59095 - held
  59096 - him
  59097 - under
  59098 - the
  59099 - arm
  59100 - Sunday
  59101 - will
  59102 - not
  59103 - strike
  59104 - from
  59105 - the
  59106 - air
  59107 - against
  59108 - us
  59109 - in
  59110 - this
  59111 - place
  59112 - said
  59113 - the
  59114 - Mariner
  59115 - after
  59116 - a
  59117 - swift
  59118 - look
  59119 - upward
  59120 - But
  59121 - here
  59122 - he
  59123 - comes
  59124 - Now
  59125 - is
  59126 - it
  59127 - truly
  59128 - your
  59129 - wish
  59130 - that
  59131 - I
  59132 - should
  59133 - break
  59134 - this
  59135 - lock
  59136 - and
  59137 - open
  59138 - this
  59139 - cage

  59141 - Arthur
  59142 - lowered
  59143 - his
  59144 - arms
  59145 - He
  59146 - looked
  59147 - up
  59148 - too
  59149 - The
  59150 - dragonfly
  59151 - was
  59152 - coming
  59153 - in
  59154 - to
  59155 - hover
  59156 - and
  59157 - he
  59158 - could
  59159 - see
  59160 - Sunday
  59161 - running
  59162 - towards
  59163 - its
  59164 - tail
  59165 - Yes
  59166 - he
  59167 - said
  59168 - This
  59169 - is
  59170 - the
  59171 - third
  59172 - of
  59173 - three
  59174 - times
  59175 - that
  59176 - I
  59177 - swore
  59178 - to
  59179 - aid
  59180 - you
  59181 - said
  59182 - the
  59183 - Mariner
  59184 - There
  59185 - will
  59186 - be
  59187 - no
  59188 - more

  59190 - Please
  59191 - Open
  59192 - it

  59194 - Sunday
  59195 - didn‘t
  59196 - wait
  59197 - for
  59198 - the
  59199 - ladder
  59200 - He
  59201 - jumped
  59202 - from
  59203 - the
  59204 - dragonfly
  59205 - fifty
  59206 - feet
  59207 - up
  59208 - without
  59209 - wings
  59210 - as
  59211 - the
  59212 - Mariner
  59213 - touched
  59214 - the
  59215 - very
  59216 - tip
  59217 - of
  59218 - his
  59219 - harpoon
  59220 - to
  59221 - the
  59222 - lock
  59223 - of
  59224 - the
  59225 - cage
  59226 - Arthur
  59227 - put
  59228 - his
  59229 - arm
  59230 - in
  59231 - front
  59232 - of
  59233 - his
  59234 - face
  59235 - expecting
  59236 - an
  59237 - explosion
  59238 - or
  59239 - at
  59240 - the
  59241 - very
  59242 - least
  59243 - a
  59244 - cascade
  59245 - of
  59246 - white-hot
  59247 - sparks
  59248 - But
  59249 - there
  59250 - was
  59251 - only
  59252 - a
  59253 - gentle
  59254 - click
  59255 - The
  59256 - door
  59257 - sprang
  59258 - open
  59259 - The
  59260 - Mariner
  59261 - took
  59262 - a
  59263 - step
  59264 - back
  59265 - and
  59266 - let
  59267 - the
  59268 - harpoon
  59269 - fall
  59270 - from
  59271 - his
  59272 - hand
  59273 - The
  59274 - weapon
  59275 - turned
  59276 - into
  59277 - water
  59278 - as
  59279 - it
  59280 - fell
  59281 - becoming
  59282 - a
  59283 - dark
  59284 - white
  59285 - crested
  59286 - wave
  59287 - that
  59288 - broke
  59289 - on
  59290 - Arthur‘s
  59291 - feet
  59292 - the
  59293 - smell
  59294 - of
  59295 - salt
  59296 - strong
  59297 - in
  59298 - the
  59299 - air

  59315 - his
  59316 - head
  59317 - to

  59320 - turned
  59321 - to
  59322 - his
  59323 - left
  59324 - and
  59325 - nodded

  59329 - Lord
  59330 - Sunday
  59331 - caught
  59332 - the
  59333 - Mariner
  59334 - as
  59335 - he
  59336 - fell
  59337 - and
  59338 - laid
  59339 - him
  59340 - down
  59341 - Then
  59342 - the
  59343 - Trustee
  59344 - clapped
  59345 - his
  59346 - hand
  59347 - to
  59348 - his
  59349 - chest
  59350 - his
  59351 - fingers
  59352 - reaching
  59353 - for
  59354 - the
  59355 - gap
  59356 - between
  59357 - the
  59358 - top
  59359 - two

  59364 - just
  59365 - above

  59367 - waistcoat
  59368 - where
  59369 - something
  59370 - gold
  59371 - gleamed
  59372 - against
  59373 - his
  59374 - skin
  59375 - But
  59376 - before
  59377 - Lord
  59378 - Sunday
  59379 - could
  59380 - touch
  59381 - whatever

  59385 - of

  59392 - out

  59397 - and
  59398 - finger-twigs
  59399 - gripped
  59400 - his
  59401 - arm
  59402 - At
  59403 - the
  59404 - same
  59405 - time
  59406 - a
  59407 - root
  59408 - exploded
  59409 - out
  59410 - of

  59417 - legs
  59418 - Tiny
  59419 - words
  59420 - and
  59421 - letters
  59422 - thronged
  59423 - and

  59425 - on
  59426 - the

  59446 - all

  59476 - Will
  59477 - Now
  59478 - The
  59479 - voice

  59483 - far
  59484 - away
  59485 - to

  59488 - as

  59556 - There
  59557 - was
  59558 - silence
  59559 - when
  59560 - Arthur
  59561 - spoke
  59562 - the
  59563 - last
  59564 - word
  59565 - The
  59566 - sounds
  59567 - of
  59568 - battle
  59569 - were
  59570 - muffled
  59571 - and
  59572 - far
  59573 - away
  59574 - Arthur
  59575 - felt
  59576 - like
  59577 - he
  59578 - was
  59579 - alone

  59581 - the
  59582 - tree-wrapped

  59584 - Sunday
  59585 - just
  59586 - the
  59587 - two
  59588 - of
  59589 - them
  59590 - on
  59591 - the
  59592 - hill

  59594 - silence
  59595 - stretched
  59596 - into
  59597 - long
  59598 - seconds
  59599 - before
  59600 - Sunday
  59601 - finally
  59602 - spoke
  59603 - You
  59604 - have
  59605 - doomed
  59606 - us
  59607 - all

  59609 - The
  59610 - tree
  59611 - retreated
  59612 - from
  59613 - Lord
  59614 - Sunday
  59615 - words
  59616 - slip
  59617 - ping
  59618 - back
  59619 - to
  59620 - branch

  59623 - these
  59624 - limbs
  59625 - shrinking
  59626 - back
  59627 - to
  59628 - the

  59630 - inside
  59631 - the
  59632 - cage
  59633 - Lord
  59634 - Sunday
  59635 - reached
  59636 - behind
  59637 - his
  59638 - neck
  59639 - Where
  59640 - is
  59641 - the
  59642 - Key

  59644 - thought
  59645 - frantically
  59646 - He
  59647 - looked
  59648 - at
  59649 - the
  59650 - tree
  59651 - in
  59652 - the
  59653 - cage
  59654 - It
  59655 - wasn‘t

  59657 - anything
  59658 - now

  59660 - Lord
  59661 - Sunday
  59662 - reaching
  59663 - for
  59664 - a
  59665 - weapon
  59666 - What
  59667 - does
  59668 - he
  59669 - mean
  59670 - that

  59672 - doomed
  59673 - us
  59674 - all
  59675 - Sunday
  59676 - lifted
  59677 - a
  59678 - chain
  59679 - from
  59680 - around
  59681 - his
  59682 - neck
  59683 - pulling
  59684 - it
  59685 - over
  59686 - his
  59687 - head
  59688 - to
  59689 - reveal
  59690 - a
  59691 - small
  59692 - shining
  59693 - object
  59694 - on
  59695 - the
  59696 - end
  59697 - of
  59698 - the
  59699 - chain
  59700 - the
  59701 - object
  59702 - that
  59703 - had
  59704 - been
  59705 - hidden
  59706 - under
  59707 - his
  59708 - shirt
  59709 - It
  59710 - was
  59711 - a
  59712 - key
  59713 - A
  59714 - tiny
  59715 - golden
  59716 - key
  59717 - the
  59718 - length
  59719 - of
  59720 - the
  59721 - smallest
  59722 - joint
  59723 - on
  59724 - Arthur‘s
  59725 - little
  59726 - finger
  59727 - Lord
  59728 - Sunday
  59729 - let
  59730 - the
  59731 - chain
  59732 - fall
  59733 - It
  59734 - hung
  59735 - in
  59736 - the
  59737 - air
  59738 - for
  59739 - a
  59740 - moment
  59741 - Then
  59742 - with
  59743 - the
  59744 - jangling
  59745 - noise
  59746 - of
  59747 - a
  59748 - falling
  59749 - harp
  59750 - the
  59751 - Seventh
  59752 - Key
  59753 - flew
  59754 - to
  59755 - Arthur
  59756 - The
  59757 - chain
  59758 - briefly
  59759 - rested
  59760 - around
  59761 - his
  59762 - head
  59763 - like
  59764 - a
  59765 - crown
  59766 - before
  59767 - it
  59768 - slipped
  59769 - down
  59770 - to
  59771 - lie
  59772 - about
  59773 - his
  59774 - neck
  59775 - the
  59776 - Key
  59777 - itself
  59778 - coming
  59779 - to
  59780 - rest
  59781 - upon
  59782 - his
  59783 - chest
  59784 - As
  59785 - it
  59786 - settled
  59787 - there
  59788 - Arthur
  59789 - felt
  59790 - a
  59791 - titanic
  59792 - infusion
  59793 - of
  59794 - certainty
  59795 - and
  59796 - confidence
  59797 - I‘ve
  59798 - done
  59799 - it
  59800 - thought
  59801 - Arthur
  59802 - I
  59803 - am
  59804 - the
  59805 - Master
  59806 - now
  59807 - The
  59808 - tree
  59809 - inside
  59810 - the
  59811 - cage
  59812 - shook
  59813 - its
  59814 - branches
  59815 - rustled
  59816 - its
  59817 - leaves
  59818 - and
  59819 - one
  59820 - by
  59821 - one
  59822 - began
  59823 - to
  59824 - draw
  59825 - its
  59826 - roots
  59827 - out
  59828 - of
  59829 - the
  59830 - earth
  59831 - Lord
  59832 - Sunday
  59833 - turned
  59834 - away
  59835 - from
  59836 - Arthur
  59837 - as
  59838 - if
  59839 - by
  59840 - not
  59841 - seeing
  59842 - him
  59843 - he
  59844 - could
  59845 - deny
  59846 - his
  59847 - existence
  59848 - Arthur
  59849 - let
  59850 - him
  59851 - Sunday
  59852 - was
  59853 - of
  59854 - no
  59855 - account
  59856 - now
  59857 - He
  59858 - simply
  59859 - didn‘t
  59860 - matter
  59861 - Arthur
  59862 - could
  59863 - feel
  59864 - the
  59865 - glorious
  59866 - power
  59867 - of
  59868 - the
  59869 - Seventh
  59870 - Key
  59871 - filling
  59872 - him
  59873 - up
  59874 - a
  59875 - power
  59876 - that
  59877 - would
  59878 - soon
  59879 - be
  59880 - augmented
  59881 - by
  59882 - all
  59883 - his
  59884 - other
  59885 - Keys
  59886 - as
  59887 - soon
  59888 - as
  59889 - Dame
  59890 - Primus
  59891 - could
  59892 - get
  59893 - there
  59894 - and
  59895 - deliver
  59896 - them
  59897 - You
  59898 - must
  59899 - stop
  59900 - the
  59901 - fighting
  59902 - said
  59903 - the
  59904 - Will
  59905 - speaking
  59906 - aloud
  59907 - It
  59908 - is
  59909 - delaying
  59910 - matters
  59911 - which
  59912 - is
  59913 - annoying
  59914 - after
  59915 - so
  59916 - long
  59917 - a
  59918 - wait
  59919 - ”
  59920 - It
  59921 - turned
  59922 - its
  59923 - trunk
  59924 - sideways
  59925 - and
  59926 - leaned
  59927 - through
  59928 - the
  59929 - door
  59930 - reaching
  59931 - out
  59932 - with
  59933 - several
  59934 - branches
  59935 - and
  59936 - some
  59937 - of
  59938 - its
  59939 - taproots
  59940 - like
  59941 - a
  59942 - contortionist
  59943 - coming
  59944 - out
  59945 - of
  59946 - a
  59947 - box
  59948 - How
  59949 - ”
  59950 - asked
  59951 - Arthur
  59952 - He
  59953 - had
  59954 - the
  59955 - power
  59956 - he
  59957 - knew
  59958 - but
  59959 - he
  59960 - wasn‘t
  59961 - sure
  59962 - how
  59963 - to
  59964 - use
  59965 - it
  59966 - Why
  59967 - not
  59968 - slay
  59969 - them
  59970 - all
  59971 - myself
  59972 - included
  59973 - ”
  59974 - suggested
  59975 - Lord
  59976 - Sunday
  59977 - bitterly
  59978 - without
  59979 - turning
  59980 - around
  59981 - You
  59982 - hold
  59983 - three
  59984 - Keys
  59985 - directly
  59986 - and
  59987 - all
  59988 - by
  59989 - acclaim
  59990 - you
  59991 - have
  59992 - the
  59993 - power
  59994 - ”
  59995 - Yes
  59996 - said
  59997 - Arthur
  59998 - He
  59999 - knew
  60000 - that
  60001 - he
  60002 - could
  60003 - I
  60004 - suppose
  60005 - I
  60006 - could
  60007 - kill
  60008 - you
  60009 - all
  60010 - ”
  60011 - It
  60012 - seemed
  60013 - like
  60014 - a
  60015 - reasonable
  60016 - suggestion
  60017 - for
  60018 - a
  60019 - moment
  60020 - perhaps
  60021 - even
  60022 - a
  60023 - useful
  60024 - exercise
  60025 - of
  60026 - his
  60027 - newfound
  60028 - power
  60029 - Arthur‘s
  60030 - hand
  60031 - crept
  60032 - to
  60033 - hold
  60034 - the
  60035 - Seventh
  60036 - Key
  60037 - but
  60038 - even
  60039 - as
  60040 - his
  60041 - fingers
  60042 - closed
  60043 - around
  60044 - it
  60045 - he
  60046 - was
  60047 - distracted
  60048 - by
  60049 - something
  60050 - The
  60051 - lingering
  60052 - scent
  60053 - of
  60054 - sea
  60055 - spray
  60056 - a
  60057 - glimpse
  60058 - of
  60059 - the
  60060 - body
  60061 - of
  60062 - a
  60063 - small
  60064 - yellow
  60065 - elephant

  60067 - old
  60068 - man
  60069 - dead
  60070 - on
  60071 - the
  60072 - ground
  60073 - with
  60074 - a
  60075 - far-travelled
  60076 - smile
  60077 - still
  60078 - on
  60079 - his
  60080 - face…
  60081 - No…what…
  60082 - said
  60083 - Arthur
  60084 - He
  60085 - groaned
  60086 - and

  60100 - He
  60101 - let
  60102 - his
  60103 - arms
  60104 - rest
  60105 - at
  60106 - his
  60107 - side
  60108 - and
  60109 - reached
  60110 - past
  60111 - the
  60112 - anger
  60113 - and
  60114 - the
  60115 - pride
  60116 - past
  60117 - the
  60118 - arrogance
  60119 - of
  60120 - power
  60121 - to
  60122 - that
  60123 - small
  60124 - inner
  60125 - core
  60126 - of
  60127 - his
  60128 - being
  60129 - where
  60130 - he
  60131 - was
  60132 - still
  60133 - a
  60134 - quiet
  60135 - thoughtful
  60136 - boy
  60137 - who
  60138 - had
  60139 - been
  60140 - brought
  60141 - up
  60142 - in
  60143 - kindness
  60144 - and
  60145 - peace
  60146 - Whatever
  60147 - else
  60148 - I
  60149 - may
  60150 - have
  60151 - become

  60154 - also
  60155 - Arthur

  60158 - repeated

  60167 - It
  60168 - would
  60169 - be
  60170 - a
  60171 - mercy
  60172 - in
  60173 - many
  60174 - ways
  60175 - said
  60176 - Lord
  60177 - Sunday
  60178 - I
  60179 - still
  60180 - find
  60181 - it
  60182 - hard
  60183 - to
  60184 - comprehend
  60185 - that
  60186 - I
  60187 - have
  60188 - failed
  60189 - How
  60190 - could
  60191 - a
  60192 - mortal
  60193 - have
  60194 - defeated
  60195 - me

  60197 - Arthur
  60198 - didn‘t
  60199 - answer
  60200 - which
  60201 - made
  60202 - Lord
  60203 - Sunday
  60204 - look
  60205 - even
  60206 - haughtier
  60207 - and
  60208 - at
  60209 - the
  60210 - same
  60211 - time
  60212 - more
  60213 - defeated
  60214 - Instead
  60215 - Arthur
  60216 - gazed
  60217 - out
  60218 - at
  60219 - the
  60220 - battle
  60221 - that
  60222 - was
  60223 - being
  60224 - fought
  60225 - across
  60226 - the
  60227 - Incomparable
  60228 - Gardens
  60229 - He
  60230 - didn‘t
  60231 - need
  60232 - a
  60233 - telescope
  60234 - now
  60235 - for
  60236 - if
  60237 - he
  60238 - wanted
  60239 - to
  60240 - he
  60241 - simply
  60242 - focused
  60243 - his
  60244 - attention
  60245 - and
  60246 - saw
  60247 - as
  60248 - closely
  60249 - as
  60250 - he
  60251 - wished
  60252 - His
  60253 - mind
  60254 - worked
  60255 - faster
  60256 - too
  60257 - processing
  60258 - the
  60259 - images
  60260 - taking
  60261 - in
  60262 - everything
  60263 - almost
  60264 - instantaneously
  60265 - He
  60266 - saw
  60267 - the
  60268 - Horde
  60269 - charging
  60270 - home
  60271 - against
  60272 - a
  60273 - flying
  60274 - hedgehog
  60275 - of
  60276 - umbrella-armed
  60277 - sorcerers
  60278 - the
  60279 - Legion
  60280 - locked
  60281 - in
  60282 - vertical

  60298 - in
  60299 - a
  60300 - confused
  60301 - circling
  60302 - melee
  60303 - that
  60304 - moved
  60305 - like
  60306 - a
  60307 - tornado
  60308 - sucking
  60309 - in
  60310 - combatants
  60311 - and

  60358 - Leaf
  60359 - off
  60360 - Daisy‘s
  60361 - back
  60362 - just
  60363 - as
  60364 - the
  60365 - sling
  60366 - finally
  60367 - tore
  60368 - apart
  60369 - holding

  60379 - its
  60380 - tentacles
  60381 - up
  60382 - and
  60383 - Borderers
  60384 - grabbed
  60385 - hold
  60386 - of
  60387 - them
  60388 - but
  60389 - with
  60390 - the
  60391 - barbed
  60392 - insects
  60393 - still
  60394 - being
  60395 - fired
  60396 - against

  60419 - She
  60420 - pointed
  60421 - down

  60423 - a
  60424 - large
  60425 - body
  60426 - of
  60427 - water

  60429 - some
  60430 - distance

  60441 - The
  60442 - beastwort

  60444 - out
  60445 - a
  60446 - long
  60447 - high-pitched
  60448 - cry
  60449 - and
  60450 - fell
  60451 - away
  60452 - with
  60453 - too
  60454 - few
  60455 - Borderers
  60456 - holding
  60457 - on
  60458 - Leaf
  60459 - took
  60460 - a
  60461 - breath
  60462 - to
  60463 - shout
  60464 - for
  60465 - more
  60466 - of
  60467 - them
  60468 - to

  60477 - the
  60478 - breath
  60479 - she
  60480 - needed
  60481 - instead
  60482 - getting
  60483 - a
  60484 - stabbing
  60485 - pain
  60486 - in
  60487 - her
  60488 - chest
  60489 - She
  60490 - coughed
  60491 - it
  60492 - out

  60495 - not

  60497 - The
  60498 - Gardens
  60499 - below

  60501 - blurry
  60502 - and
  60503 - for
  60504 - a
  60505 - moment
  60506 - she

  60508 - know
  60509 - where

  60519 - she

  60523 - she‘ll
  60524 - hit
  60525 - the
  60526 - lake

  60528 - Suzy
  60529 - She
  60530 - was
  60531 - flying
  60532 - upward
  60533 - as
  60534 - fast
  60535 - as
  60536 - she
  60537 - could
  60538 - trying
  60539 - to
  60540 - get
  60541 - out
  60542 - of
  60543 - range
  60544 - of

  60546 - spiked
  60547 - insects
  60548 - The
  60549 - living

  60552 - being
  60553 - propelled
  60554 - upward
  60555 - out
  60556 - of
  60557 - strange
  60558 - bulbous
  60559 - flowers
  60560 - full
  60561 - of
  60562 - a
  60563 - pink

  60565 - but
  60566 - the
  60567 - flowers

  60590 - Leaf
  60591 - nodded
  60592 - and
  60593 - pressed
  60594 - her
  60595 - hands
  60596 - into
  60597 - her
  60598 - eyes

  60606 - her

  60623 - Suzy
  60624 - So
  60625 - I
  60626 - doubled
  60627 - back
  60628 - ”
  60629 - Are
  60630 - we
  60631 - winning
  60632 - ”
  60633 - Leaf
  60634 - asked
  60635 - She
  60636 - couldn‘t
  60637 - concentrate
  60638 - couldn‘t
  60639 - look
  60640 - out
  60641 - It
  60642 - was
  60643 - easier
  60644 - just
  60645 - to
  60646 - hang
  60647 - in
  60648 - Suzy‘s
  60649 - arms
  60650 - and
  60651 - ask
  60652 - the
  60653 - question
  60654 - Dunno
  60655 - said
  60656 - Suzy
  60657 - But
  60658 - we‘re
  60659 - making
  60660 - ground
  60661 - Or
  60662 - air
  60663 - Only
  60664 - a
  60665 - few
  60666 - miles
  60667 - from
  60668 - the
  60669 - Elysium
  60670 - now
  60671 - But
  60672 - the
  60673 - Piper‘s
  60674 - ahead

  60678 - Keep
  60679 - lots
  60680 - of
  60681 - soldiers
  60682 - in
  60683 - between
  60684 - us
  60685 - then
  60686 - said
  60687 - Leaf
  60688 - She
  60689 - was
  60690 - having
  60691 - trouble
  60692 - staying
  60693 - conscious
  60694 - and
  60695 - the
  60696 - world
  60697 - kept
  60698 - slipping
  60699 - away
  60700 - darkness
  60701 - alternating
  60702 - with
  60703 - flashes
  60704 - of
  60705 - confused
  60706 - light
  60707 - and
  60708 - sound
  60709 - Do
  60710 - my
  60711 - best

  60713 - Suzy
  60714 - She
  60715 - was
  60716 - looking
  60717 - for
  60718 - her
  60719 - Raiders
  60720 - but
  60721 - couldn‘t
  60722 - see
  60723 - them
  60724 - There
  60725 - was
  60726 - fighting
  60727 - everywhere
  60728 - and
  60729 - it
  60730 - was
  60731 - difficult
  60732 - to
  60733 - work
  60734 - out
  60735 - where
  60736 - to
  60737 - go
  60738 - The
  60739 - Elysium
  60740 - did
  60741 - lie
  60742 - ahead
  60743 - the
  60744 - hill
  60745 - one
  60746 - of
  60747 - the
  60748 - few
  60749 - landmarks
  60750 - Suzy
  60751 - could
  60752 - easily
  60753 - spot
  60754 - But
  60755 - the
  60756 - battle
  60757 - was
  60758 - especially
  60759 - heavy
  60760 - around
  60761 - it…though
  60762 - Suzy
  60763 - frowned
  60764 - as
  60765 - she
  60766 - realized
  60767 - that
  60768 - there
  60769 - were
  60770 - no
  60771 - longer
  60772 - any
  60773 - insects
  60774 - or
  60775 - dragonflies
  60776 - defending
  60777 - the
  60778 - place
  60779 - Instead
  60780 - the
  60781 - air
  60782 - above
  60783 - the
  60784 - hill
  60785 - was
  60786 - packed
  60787 - with
  60788 - Newniths
  60789 - and
  60790 - sorcerers
  60791 - who
  60792 - were
  60793 - desperately
  60794 - holding
  60795 - back
  60796 - multiple
  60797 - assaults
  60798 - by
  60799 - different
  60800 - units
  60801 - of
  60802 - the
  60803 - Glorious
  60804 - Army
  60805 - of
  60806 - the
  60807 - Architect

  60809 - Piper
  60810 - must
  60811 - be
  60812 - there
  60813 - already

  60815 - said
  60816 - to
  60817 - herself
  60818 - And
  60819 - it
  60820 - looks
  60821 - like
  60822 - something‘s
  60823 - happened
  60824 - to
  60825 - Sunday
  60826 - ‘Oo
  60827 - would
  60828 - have
  60829 - thought
  60830 - I
  60831 - hope
  60832 - you‘re
  60833 - there
  60834 - too

  60837 - She
  60838 - tapped
  60839 - her
  60840 - ears
  60841 - to
  60842 - check
  60843 - the
  60844 - plugs
  60845 - were
  60846 - in
  60847 - and
  60848 - swooped
  60849 - down
  60850 - behind
  60851 - a
  60852 - cohort
  60853 - of
  60854 - Legionaries
  60855 - who
  60856 - were
  60857 - about
  60858 - to
  60859 - descend
  60860 - against
  60861 - the
  60862 - defenders
  60863 - of
  60864 - the
  60865 - Elysium
  60866 - hill
  60867 - Arthur
  60868 - had
  60869 - just
  60870 - decided
  60871 - how
  60872 - to
  60873 - make
  60874 - the
  60875 - fighting
  60876 - stop
  60877 - when
  60878 - the
  60879 - Piper
  60880 - and
  60881 - Saturday
  60882 - landed
  60883 - by
  60884 - the
  60885 - stream
  60886 - their
  60887 - respective
  60888 - bodyguards
  60889 - flying
  60890 - back
  60891 - up
  60892 - to
  60893 - join
  60894 - the
  60895 - rearguard
  60896 - that
  60897 - was
  60898 - slowly
  60899 - being
  60900 - pressed
  60901 - back
  60902 - and
  60903 - down
  60904 - by
  60905 - the
  60906 - forces
  60907 - of
  60908 - Dame
  60909 - Primus
  60910 - Both
  60911 - of
  60912 - Arthur‘s
  60913 - enemies
  60914 - wore
  60915 - black-lacquered
  60916 - leather
  60917 - wings
  60918 - which
  60919 - looked
  60920 - odd
  60921 - against
  60922 - the
  60923 - Piper‘s
  60924 - yellow
  60925 - greatcoat
  60926 - and
  60927 - fashionable
  60928 - with
  60929 - Superior
  60930 - Saturday‘s
  60931 - new
  60932 - armor
  60933 - of
  60934 - reddish
  60935 - plates
  60936 - But
  60937 - Saturday
  60938 - was
  60939 - no
  60940 - longer
  60941 - as
  60942 - tall
  60943 - as
  60944 - she
  60945 - had
  60946 - been
  60947 - nor
  60948 - as
  60949 - astonishingly
  60950 - beautiful
  60951 - and
  60952 - she
  60953 - remained

  60965 - Piper
  60966 - lifted
  60967 - his
  60968 - gold-masked
  60969 - face
  60970 - to
  60971 - Arthur
  60972 - and
  60973 - spoke
  60974 - his
  60975 - voice
  60976 - as
  60977 - mellifluous
  60978 - and
  60979 - charming
  60980 - as
  60981 - it
  60982 - had

  61020 - is
  61021 - my
  61022 - business
  61023 - said
  61024 - Arthur
  61025 - shortly
  61026 - I
  61027 - give
  61028 - you
  61029 - permission
  61030 - to

  61032 - yourself

  61034 - your
  61035 - army
  61036 - and
  61037 - Saturday
  61038 - as
  61039 - well

  61041 - To
  61042 - where
  61043 - ”
  61044 - asked
  61045 - the
  61046 - Piper
  61047 - He
  61048 - spoke
  61049 - as
  61050 - if
  61051 - to
  61052 - an
  61053 - old
  61054 - friend
  61055 - The
  61056 - House
  61057 - has
  61058 - been
  61059 - eaten
  61060 - up
  61061 - by
  61062 - Nothing
  61063 - Arthur
  61064 - Only
  61065 - the
  61066 - Gardens
  61067 - remain
  61068 - and
  61069 - perhaps
  61070 - not
  61071 - even
  61072 - that
  61073 - at
  61074 - least
  61075 - not
  61076 - for
  61077 - very
  61078 - long
  61079 - Not
  61080 - unless
  61081 - you
  61082 - let
  61083 - me

  61085 - matters

  61089 - I
  61090 - will
  61091 - force
  61092 - the
  61093 - Nothing

  61096 - Arthur
  61097 - You

  61099 - your
  61100 - world

  61102 - Return
  61103 - there

  61105 - It
  61106 - too
  61107 - is
  61108 - gone
  61109 - said
  61110 - the
  61111 - Piper
  61112 - mournfully
  61113 - Lost
  61114 - all
  61115 - will
  61116 - be
  61117 - lost
  61118 - Unless
  61119 - you
  61120 - give
  61121 - me
  61122 - your
  61123 - Keys
  61124 - They
  61125 - are
  61126 - too
  61127 - great
  61128 - a
  61129 - burden
  61130 - for
  61131 - a
  61132 - mortal
  61133 - Better
  61134 - I
  61135 - take
  61136 - them
  61137 - and
  61138 - put
  61139 - everything
  61140 - to—
  61141 - It
  61142 - is
  61143 - too
  61144 - late
  61145 - for
  61146 - your
  61147 - tricks

  61149 - Lord
  61150 - Sunday
  61151 - He
  61152 - is
  61153 - too
  61154 - strong

  61156 - and
  61157 - let
  61158 - us
  61159 - finish

  61162 - Too
  61163 - proud

  61167 - the
  61168 - last

  61170 - you

  61172 - snapped
  61173 - the
  61174 - Piper
  61175 - None
  61176 - of
  61177 - this
  61178 - would
  61179 - have
  61180 - happened
  61181 - if
  61182 - you
  61183 - had
  61184 - not
  61185 - been
  61186 - too
  61187 - haughty
  61188 - to
  61189 - raise
  61190 - your
  61191 - hand
  61192 - But
  61193 - I
  61194 - bested
  61195 - by
  61196 - a
  61197 - mortal
  61198 - I
  61199 - think
  61200 - not
  61201 - ”
  61202 - He
  61203 - shook
  61204 - his
  61205 - sleeve
  61206 - and
  61207 - a
  61208 - pipe
  61209 - appeared
  61210 - in
  61211 - his
  61212 - hand
  61213 - He
  61214 - had
  61215 - it
  61216 - at
  61217 - the
  61218 - mouth-hole
  61219 - of
  61220 - his
  61221 - mask
  61222 - his
  61223 - fingers
  61224 - over
  61225 - the
  61226 - holes
  61227 - when
  61228 - Arthur
  61229 - spoke
  61230 - No
  61231 - he
  61232 - said
  61233 - and
  61234 - touched
  61235 - the
  61236 - Seventh
  61237 - Key
  61238 - I
  61239 - would
  61240 - like
  61241 - to
  61242 - hear
  61243 - you
  61244 - play
  61245 - Piper
  61246 - but
  61247 - not
  61248 - dance
  61249 - to
  61250 - your
  61251 - tune
  61252 - I
  61253 - think
  61254 - there
  61255 - has
  61256 - been
  61257 - enough
  61258 - fighting
  61259 - ”
  61260 - The
  61261 - Piper‘s
  61262 - hand
  61263 - clenched
  61264 - into
  61265 - a
  61266 - useless
  61267 - claw
  61268 - and
  61269 - the
  61270 - pipe
  61271 - fell
  61272 - to
  61273 - the
  61274 - ground
  61275 - Saturday
  61276 - bent
  61277 - to
  61278 - pick
  61279 - it
  61280 - up
  61281 - and
  61282 - returned
  61283 - it
  61284 - to
  61285 - her
  61286 - Master
  61287 - He
  61288 - took
  61289 - it
  61290 - slowly
  61291 - then
  61292 - suddenly
  61293 - tried
  61294 - to
  61295 - put
  61296 - it
  61297 - to
  61298 - his
  61299 - mouth
  61300 - again
  61301 - No
  61302 - said
  61303 - Arthur
  61304 - even
  61305 - more
  61306 - firmly
  61307 - The
  61308 - pipe
  61309 - blazed
  61310 - with
  61311 - a
  61312 - sudden
  61313 - fire
  61314 - that
  61315 - ran
  61316 - from
  61317 - end
  61318 - to
  61319 - end
  61320 - The
  61321 - instrument
  61322 - became
  61323 - a
  61324 - stick
  61325 - of
  61326 - ashes
  61327 - and
  61328 - then
  61329 - the
  61330 - ashes
  61331 - blew
  61332 - away
  61333 - The
  61334 - Piper‘s
  61335 - shoulders
  61336 - sagged
  61337 - So
  61338 - said
  61339 - the
  61340 - Piper
  61341 - I
  61342 - would
  61343 - have
  61344 - liked
  61345 - mortals
  61346 - less
  61347 - if
  61348 - I
  61349 - knew
  61350 - what
  61351 - they
  61352 - might
  61353 - become
  61354 - ”
  61355 - He
  61356 - reached
  61357 - up
  61358 - and
  61359 - removed
  61360 - his
  61361 - mask
  61362 - Arthur
  61363 - watched
  61364 - intently
  61365 - ready
  61366 - for
  61367 - some
  61368 - trick
  61369 - or
  61370 - sneak
  61371 - attack
  61372 - But
  61373 - he
  61374 - wasn‘t
  61375 - prepared
  61376 - for
  61377 - what
  61378 - he
  61379 - saw
  61380 - There
  61381 - was
  61382 - only
  61383 - the
  61384 - ghost
  61385 - of
  61386 - a
  61387 - face
  61388 - behind
  61389 - the
  61390 - mask
  61391 - faint
  61392 - traces
  61393 - of
  61394 - light
  61395 - sketching
  61396 - out
  61397 - someone
  61398 - who
  61399 - once
  61400 - would
  61401 - have
  61402 - looked
  61403 - a
  61404 - little
  61405 - like
  61406 - Lord
  61407 - Sunday
  61408 - I
  61409 - see
  61410 - no
  61411 - reason
  61412 - to
  61413 - continue
  61414 - the
  61415 - struggle
  61416 - to
  61417 - hold
  61418 - myself
  61419 - together
  61420 - just
  61421 - to
  61422 - share
  61423 - your
  61424 - company
  61425 - for
  61426 - these
  61427 - last
  61428 - few
  61429 - minutes

  61431 - the
  61432 - Piper
  61433 - to
  61434 - Arthur
  61435 - He
  61436 - turned
  61437 - to
  61438 - Sunday
  61439 - But
  61440 - tell
  61441 - me
  61442 - brother
  61443 - –
  61444 - was
  61445 - it
  61446 - you
  61447 - who
  61448 - cast
  61449 - me
  61450 - into
  61451 - Nothing
  61452 - some
  61453 - seven
  61454 - centuries
  61455 - ago
  61456 - ”
  61457 - Not
  61458 - I
  61459 - said
  61460 - Sunday
  61461 - Would
  61462 - I
  61463 - stoop
  61464 - to
  61465 - such
  61466 - a
  61467 - thing

  61469 - The
  61470 - Piper
  61471 - looked
  61472 - at
  61473 - Saturday
  61474 - She
  61475 - cringed
  61476 - before
  61477 - his
  61478 - gaze
  61479 - My
  61480 - Rats
  61481 - told
  61482 - me
  61483 - it
  61484 - was
  61485 - you
  61486 - I
  61487 - should
  61488 - have
  61489 - believed
  61490 - them

  61492 - Saturday
  61493 - cried
  61494 - out
  61495 - as
  61496 - the
  61497 - Piper
  61498 - suddenly
  61499 - lunged
  61500 - a
  61501 - knife
  61502 - with
  61503 - a
  61504 - blade
  61505 - as
  61506 - dark
  61507 - as
  61508 - night
  61509 - appearing
  61510 - in
  61511 - his
  61512 - hand
  61513 - He
  61514 - plunged
  61515 - it
  61516 - deep
  61517 - into
  61518 - Saturday‘s
  61519 - chest
  61520 - and
  61521 - twisted
  61522 - the
  61523 - hilt
  61524 - An
  61525 - instant
  61526 - too
  61527 - late
  61528 - Arthur
  61529 - directed
  61530 - the
  61531 - power
  61532 - of
  61533 - the
  61534 - Key
  61535 - against
  61536 - him
  61537 - throwing
  61538 - the
  61539 - Piper
  61540 - back
  61541 - a
  61542 - dozen
  61543 - feet
  61544 - He
  61545 - landed
  61546 - on
  61547 - his
  61548 - feet
  61549 - but
  61550 - did
  61551 - not
  61552 - move
  61553 - In
  61554 - this
  61555 - at
  61556 - least
  61557 - I
  61558 - command
  61559 - my
  61560 - destiny

  61562 - Piper
  61563 - said
  61564 - Enjoy
  61565 - your
  61566 - triumph
  61567 - while
  61568 - it
  61569 - lasts

  61572 - He
  61573 - dropped
  61574 - the
  61575 - mask
  61576 - he
  61577 - held
  61578 - in
  61579 - his
  61580 - left
  61581 - hand
  61582 - As
  61583 - it
  61584 - hit
  61585 - the
  61586 - paving
  61587 - stones
  61588 - his
  61589 - lightly
  61590 - sketched
  61591 - face
  61592 - suddenly
  61593 - winked
  61594 - out
  61595 - like
  61596 - a
  61597 - hologram
  61598 - turned
  61599 - off
  61600 - and
  61601 - his
  61602 - yellow
  61603 - coat
  61604 - fell
  61605 - to
  61606 - the
  61607 - ground

  61609 - was
  61610 - no

  61620 - the
  61621 - golden
  61622 - mask

  61624 - deserved
  61625 - better
  61626 - croaked
  61627 - Saturday
  61628 - If
  61629 - I
  61630 - had
  61631 - been
  61632 - made
  61633 - Sunday—
  61634 - She
  61635 - fell
  61636 - face
  61637 - down
  61638 - The
  61639 - Nothing
  61640 - from
  61641 - the
  61642 - Piper‘s
  61643 - blade
  61644 - continued
  61645 - to
  61646 - dissolve
  61647 - the
  61648 - greater
  61649 - part
  61650 - of
  61651 - her
  61652 - body
  61653 - including
  61654 - her
  61655 - head
  61656 - It
  61657 - would
  61658 - have
  61659 - spread
  61660 - further
  61661 - but
  61662 - Arthur
  61663 - stopped
  61664 - it
  61665 - forcing
  61666 - the
  61667 - Nothing
  61668 - to
  61669 - become
  61670 - the
  61671 - blade
  61672 - of
  61673 - a
  61674 - knife
  61675 - once

  61683 - the
  61684 - Will

  61686 - other
  61687 - Parts
  61688 - need
  61689 - to
  61690 - join
  61691 - me

  61698 - Arthur
  61699 - nodded
  61700 - and
  61701 - held
  61702 - the
  61703 - Seventh
  61704 - Key
  61705 - tighter
  61706 - as
  61707 - he
  61708 - straightened
  61709 - to
  61710 - his
  61711 - full
  61712 - height

  61714 - overtopped
  61715 - Lord
  61716 - Sunday
  61717 - now
  61718 - he
  61719 - saw
  61720 - which
  61721 - meant
  61722 - he
  61723 - was
  61724 - around
  61725 - ten
  61726 - feet
  61727 - tall
  61728 - He
  61729 - also
  61730 - had
  61731 - wings
  61732 - though
  61733 - he
  61734 - had
  61735 - no
  61736 - memory
  61737 - of
  61738 - putting
  61739 - them
  61740 - on

  61830 - His

  61845 - a

  61987 - towards
  61988 - the

  61990 - swerving
  61991 - between

  62010 - idea
  62011 - of

  62013 - was
  62014 - equally
  62015 - attractive
  62016 - to
  62017 - all
  62018 - participants
  62019 - though
  62020 - perhaps
  62021 - this
  62022 - was
  62023 - only
  62024 - because
  62025 - the
  62026 - power
  62027 - of
  62028 - the
  62029 - Seventh
  62030 - Key
  62031 - had
  62032 - taken
  62033 - away
  62034 - the
  62035 - madness
  62036 - of
  62037 - battle

  62046 - become
  62047 - very
  62048 - tall
  62049 - and
  62050 - even
  62051 - more
  62052 - impossibly
  62053 - good-
  62054 - looking
  62055 - He
  62056 - was
  62057 - a
  62058 - head
  62059 - taller
  62060 - than
  62061 - Lord
  62062 - Sunday
  62063 - who
  62064 - stood
  62065 - behind
  62066 - him
  62067 - next
  62068 - to
  62069 - a
  62070 - stunted
  62071 - apple
  62072 - tree
  62073 - that
  62074 - was
  62075 - swaying
  62076 - on
  62077 - exposed
  62078 - roots
  62079 - as
  62080 - if
  62081 - it

  62083 - on
  62084 - tiptoe
  62085 - Arthur
  62086 - himself
  62087 - was
  62088 - leaning
  62089 - on
  62090 - a
  62091 - tall
  62092 - cage
  62093 - made
  62094 - of
  62095 - gilded
  62096 - bars
  62097 - and
  62098 - staring
  62099 - into
  62100 - the
  62101 - distance
  62102 - Dame
  62103 - Primus
  62104 - was
  62105 - a
  62106 - dozen
  62107 - yards
  62108 - ahead
  62109 - of
  62110 - Suzy
  62111 - She
  62112 - landed
  62113 - next
  62114 - to
  62115 - the
  62116 - cage
  62117 - and
  62118 - folded
  62119 - her
  62120 - wings
  62121 - Suzy
  62122 - landed
  62123 - behind
  62124 - her
  62125 - but
  62126 - not
  62127 - too
  62128 - close
  62129 - and
  62130 - let
  62131 - go
  62132 - of
  62133 - Leaf
  62134 - who
  62135 - took
  62136 - a
  62137 - few
  62138 - shaky
  62139 - steps
  62140 - forward
  62141 - Dr
  62142 - Scamandros
  62143 - and
  62144 - Giac
  62145 - at
  62146 - once
  62147 - went
  62148 - to
  62149 - either
  62150 - side
  62151 - and
  62152 - took
  62153 - her
  62154 - arms
  62155 - to
  62156 - keep
  62157 - her
  62158 - steady
  62159 - Thanks
  62160 - whispered
  62161 - Leaf
  62162 - She
  62163 - whispered
  62164 - because
  62165 - she
  62166 - suddenly
  62167 - felt
  62168 - like
  62169 - she
  62170 - shouldn‘t
  62171 - be
  62172 - there
  62173 - It
  62174 - was
  62175 - like
  62176 - dropping
  62177 - in
  62178 - unannounced
  62179 - on
  62180 - the
  62181 - inauguration
  62182 - of
  62183 - the
  62184 - president
  62185 - or
  62186 - the
  62187 - coronation
  62188 - of
  62189 - the
  62190 - queen
  62191 - or
  62192 - something
  62193 - made
  62194 - somehow
  62195 - worse
  62196 - and
  62197 - more
  62198 - terrifying
  62199 - because
  62200 - Arthur
  62201 - didn‘t
  62202 - look
  62203 - like
  62204 - Arthur
  62205 - any
  62206 - more
  62207 - He
  62208 - was
  62209 - too
  62210 - dazzling
  62211 - too
  62212 - bright
  62213 - and
  62214 - obviously
  62215 - too
  62216 - far
  62217 - beyond
  62218 - human
  62219 - for
  62220 - Leaf
  62221 - to
  62222 - even
  62223 - think
  62224 - of
  62225 - him
  62226 - as
  62227 - the
  62228 - boy
  62229 - he
  62230 - had
  62231 - once
  62232 - been
  62233 - You
  62234 - have
  62235 - done
  62236 - well
  62237 - Arthur
  62238 - boomed
  62239 - Dame
  62240 - Primus
  62241 - You
  62242 - are
  62243 - in
  62244 - truth

  62246 - Rightful
  62247 - Heir

  62249 - I
  62250 - am
  62251 - said
  62252 - Arthur
  62253 - I
  62254 - would
  62255 - have
  62256 - my
  62257 - Keys
  62258 - so
  62259 - that
  62260 - I
  62261 - may
  62262 - turn
  62263 - back
  62264 - the
  62265 - Nothing
  62266 - and
  62267 - rebuild

  62269 - Kingdom

  62271 - Dame
  62272 - Primus
  62273 - inclined
  62274 - her
  62275 - head
  62276 - graciously
  62277 - With
  62278 - that
  62279 - movement
  62280 - the
  62281 - clock-hand
  62282 - sword
  62283 - that
  62284 - was
  62285 - the
  62286 - First
  62287 - Key
  62288 - flew
  62289 - to
  62290 - Arthur‘s
  62291 - belt
  62292 - The
  62293 - gauntlets
  62294 - of
  62295 - the
  62296 - Second
  62297 - Key
  62298 - disappeared
  62299 - from
  62300 - the
  62301 - Will‘s
  62302 - hands
  62303 - and
  62304 - reappeared
  62305 - on
  62306 - Arthur‘s
  62307 - The
  62308 - trident
  62309 - and
  62310 - baton
  62311 - brooch
  62312 - split
  62313 - into
  62314 - the
  62315 - Third
  62316 - and
  62317 - Fourth
  62318 - Keys
  62319 - and
  62320 - grew
  62321 - somewhat
  62322 - before
  62323 - flipping
  62324 - end
  62325 - over
  62326 - end
  62327 - to
  62328 - join
  62329 - the
  62330 - sword
  62331 - at
  62332 - Arthur‘s
  62333 - belt
  62334 - The
  62335 - Fifth
  62336 - Key
  62337 - which
  62338 - Arthur
  62339 - already
  62340 - had
  62341 - joined
  62342 - the
  62343 - Seventh
  62344 - Key
  62345 - on
  62346 - the
  62347 - chain
  62348 - around
  62349 - his
  62350 - neck
  62351 - and
  62352 - the
  62353 - quill
  62354 - pen
  62355 - that
  62356 - was
  62357 - the
  62358 - Sixth
  62359 - Key
  62360 - slid
  62361 - into
  62362 - position
  62363 - above
  62364 - his
  62365 - left
  62366 - ear
  62367 - Arthur
  62368 - smiled
  62369 - and
  62370 - raised
  62371 - his
  62372 - hands
  62373 - letting
  62374 - the
  62375 - power
  62376 - of
  62377 - all
  62378 - seven
  62379 - Keys
  62380 - infuse
  62381 - his
  62382 - being
  62383 - I
  62384 - can
  62385 - do
  62386 - anything
  62387 - now
  62388 - he
  62389 - thought
  62390 - Anything
  62391 - at
  62392 - all…
  62393 - Dame
  62394 - Primus
  62395 - picked
  62396 - one
  62397 - of
  62398 - the
  62399 - tiny
  62400 - wizened
  62401 - apples
  62402 - from
  62403 - the
  62404 - Part
  62405 - Seven
  62406 - tree
  62407 - and
  62408 - bit
  62409 - into
  62410 - it
  62411 - with
  62412 - her
  62413 - perfect
  62414 - teeth
  62415 - The
  62416 - sound
  62417 - was
  62418 - sharp
  62419 - and
  62420 - incredibly
  62421 - loud
  62422 - redolent
  62423 - with
  62424 - the
  62425 - snap
  62426 - of
  62427 - something
  62428 - breaking
  62429 - that
  62430 - isn‘t
  62431 - meant
  62432 - to
  62433 - break
  62434 - Arthur
  62435 - felt
  62436 - that
  62437 - sound
  62438 - like
  62439 - a
  62440 - blow
  62441 - to
  62442 - the
  62443 - stomach
  62444 - He
  62445 - dropped
  62446 - his
  62447 - hands
  62448 - and
  62449 - stared
  62450 - as
  62451 - the
  62452 - tree
  62453 - and
  62454 - Dame
  62455 - Primus
  62456 - stepped
  62457 - into
  62458 - each
  62459 - other
  62460 - For
  62461 - a
  62462 - moment
  62463 - they
  62464 - were
  62465 - mighty
  62466 - Denizen
  62467 - and
  62468 - stunted
  62469 - tree
  62470 - then
  62471 - both
  62472 - joined
  62473 - to
  62474 - become
  62475 - a
  62476 - column
  62477 - of
  62478 - swirling
  62479 - words
  62480 - Words
  62481 - of
  62482 - fire
  62483 - so
  62484 - hot
  62485 - and
  62486 - bright
  62487 - they
  62488 - could
  62489 - be
  62490 - seen
  62491 - through
  62492 - closed
  62493 - eyelids

  62495 - even
  62496 - if
  62497 - you
  62498 - looked
  62499 - away
  62500 - There
  62501 - were
  62502 - millions
  62503 - of
  62504 - words
  62505 - but
  62506 - one
  62507 - phrase
  62508 - was
  62509 - repeated
  62510 - over
  62511 - and
  62512 - over
  62513 - again
  62514 - clear
  62515 - not
  62516 - only
  62517 - to
  62518 - Arthur
  62519 - with
  62520 - his
  62521 - newfound
  62522 - mental
  62523 - powers
  62524 - but
  62525 - to
  62526 - everyone
  62527 - else
  62528 - as
  62529 - well
  62530 - I
  62531 - am
  62532 - the
  62533 - Will
  62534 - of
  62535 - the
  62536 - Architect
  62537 - said
  62538 - the
  62539 - burning
  62540 - words
  62541 - Let
  62542 - the
  62543 - Will
  62544 - be
  62545 - done
  62546 - Arthur
  62547 - read
  62548 - this
  62549 - phrase
  62550 - and
  62551 - to
  62552 - his
  62553 - horror
  62554 - found
  62555 - that
  62556 - he
  62557 - had
  62558 - spoken
  62559 - it
  62560 - aloud
  62561 - unknowing
  62562 - without
  62563 - conscious
  62564 - direction
  62565 - His
  62566 - mighty
  62567 - voice
  62568 - and
  62569 - the
  62570 - power
  62571 - of
  62572 - the
  62573 - Keys
  62574 - had
  62575 - been
  62576 - conscripted
  62577 - to
  62578 - the
  62579 - Will‘s
  62580 - purpose
  62581 - the
  62582 - execution
  62583 - of
  62584 - long-delayed
  62585 - intent
  62586 - What
  62587 - that
  62588 - intent
  62589 - was
  62590 - became
  62591 - immediately
  62592 - apparent
  62593 - Beyond
  62594 - the
  62595 - hill
  62596 - of
  62597 - the
  62598 - Elysium
  62599 - with
  62600 - a
  62601 - roar
  62602 - like
  62603 - a
  62604 - thousand
  62605 - planes
  62606 - taking
  62607 - off
  62608 - a
  62609 - great
  62610 - gout
  62611 - of
  62612 - Nothing
  62613 - burst
  62614 - from
  62615 - the
  62616 - ground
  62617 - continuing
  62618 - upward
  62619 - to
  62620 - cut
  62621 - through
  62622 - the
  62623 - ceiling
  62624 - of
  62625 - the
  62626 - sky
  62627 - A
  62628 - second
  62629 - later
  62630 - through
  62631 - the
  62632 - great
  62633 - gash
  62634 - in
  62635 - the
  62636 - fabric
  62637 - of
  62638 - the
  62639 - House
  62640 - above
  62641 - an
  62642 - answering
  62643 - torrent
  62644 - of
  62645 - Nothing
  62646 - came
  62647 - cascading
  62648 - back
  62649 - down
  62650 - Thousands
  62651 - of
  62652 - Denizens
  62653 - insects
  62654 - Newniths
  62655 - and
  62656 - others
  62657 - were
  62658 - destroyed
  62659 - in
  62660 - this
  62661 - first
  62662 - assault
  62663 - from
  62664 - the
  62665 - Void
  62666 - A
  62667 - few
  62668 - seconds
  62669 - later
  62670 - before
  62671 - anyone
  62672 - could
  62673 - react
  62674 - another
  62675 - fountain
  62676 - of
  62677 - Nothing
  62678 - burst
  62679 - up
  62680 - and
  62681 - another
  62682 - Nothing
  62683 - spread
  62684 - everywhere
  62685 - annihilating
  62686 - the
  62687 - Gardens
  62688 - as
  62689 - quickly
  62690 - as
  62691 - someone
  62692 - might
  62693 - wipe
  62694 - a
  62695 - table
  62696 - clean
  62697 - Stop
  62698 - it
  62699 - Arthur
  62700 - ”
  62701 - cried
  62702 - Leaf
  62703 - Stop
  62704 - it
  62705 - ”
  62706 - Arthur
  62707 - tried
  62708 - to
  62709 - turn
  62710 - to
  62711 - her
  62712 - his
  62713 - face
  62714 - contorted
  62715 - with
  62716 - the
  62717 - useless
  62718 - effort
  62719 - He
  62720 - tried
  62721 - to
  62722 - speak
  62723 - but
  62724 - could
  62725 - not
  62726 - He
  62727 - tried
  62728 - to
  62729 - use
  62730 - the
  62731 - Keys
  62732 - against
  62733 - the
  62734 - Nothing
  62735 - that
  62736 - was
  62737 - pouring
  62738 - in
  62739 - on
  62740 - all
  62741 - sides
  62742 - but
  62743 - he
  62744 - couldn‘t
  62745 - do
  62746 - that
  62747 - either
  62748 - He
  62749 - had
  62750 - become
  62751 - a
  62752 - mere
  62753 - channel
  62754 - a
  62755 - conduit
  62756 - for
  62757 - the
  62758 - Will
  62759 - The
  62760 - others
  62761 - were
  62762 - also
  62763 - fixed
  62764 - in
  62765 - place
  62766 - The
  62767 - tendons
  62768 - on
  62769 - the
  62770 - back
  62771 - of
  62772 - Suzy‘s
  62773 - hand

  62775 - taut
  62776 - her
  62777 - sword
  62778 - drawn
  62779 - a
  62780 - mere
  62781 - half
  62782 - inch
  62783 - from
  62784 - its
  62785 - sheath
  62786 - Dr
  62787 - Scamandros‘s
  62788 - fingers
  62789 - had
  62790 - only
  62791 - touched
  62792 - his
  62793 - pocket
  62794 - Both
  62795 - Giac
  62796 - and
  62797 - Fred
  62798 - had
  62799 - just
  62800 - managed
  62801 - to
  62802 - shut
  62803 - their
  62804 - eyes
  62805 - Nothing
  62806 - spread
  62807 - to
  62808 - the
  62809 - edge
  62810 - of
  62811 - the
  62812 - lawn
  62813 - and
  62814 - high
  62815 - waves
  62816 - of
  62817 - it
  62818 - crested
  62819 - together
  62820 - above
  62821 - Arthur‘s
  62822 - head
  62823 - But
  62824 - the
  62825 - waves
  62826 - did
  62827 - not
  62828 - come
  62829 - crashing
  62830 - down
  62831 - The
  62832 - Nothing
  62833 - stopped
  62834 - as
  62835 - if
  62836 - an
  62837 - invisible
  62838 - dome
  62839 - covered
  62840 - the
  62841 - small
  62842 - paved
  62843 - area
  62844 - of
  62845 - the
  62846 - Elysium
  62847 - It
  62848 - had
  62849 - only
  62850 - taken
  62851 - a
  62852 - few
  62853 - seconds
  62854 - but
  62855 - the
  62856 - Incomparable
  62857 - Gardens
  62858 - were
  62859 - destroyed
  62860 - and
  62861 - with
  62862 - them
  62863 - nearly
  62864 - all
  62865 - the
  62866 - Denizens
  62867 - Newniths
  62868 - and

  62884 - and
  62885 - the
  62886 - Will
  62887 - survived
  62888 - A
  62889 - word
  62890 - inside
  62891 - the
  62892 - column
  62893 - of
  62894 - burning
  62895 - letters
  62896 - flashed
  62897 - and
  62898 - Arthur
  62899 - and
  62900 - his
  62901 - friends
  62902 - found
  62903 - their
  62904 - mouths
  62905 - at
  62906 - least
  62907 - unfrozen
  62908 - though
  62909 - they
  62910 - still
  62911 - could
  62912 - not
  62913 - move
  62914 - I
  62915 - regret
  62916 - to
  62917 - say…
  62918 - began
  62919 - Dr
  62920 - Scamandros
  62921 - whose
  62922 - face
  62923 - was
  62924 - for
  62925 - once
  62926 - completely
  62927 - clear
  62928 - of
  62929 - tattoos
  62930 - But
  62931 - whatever
  62932 - he
  62933 - regretted
  62934 - was
  62935 - not
  62936 - heard
  62937 - for
  62938 - he
  62939 - suddenly
  62940 - stopped
  62941 - talking
  62942 - in
  62943 - order
  62944 - to
  62945 - gasp
  62946 - as
  62947 - someone
  62948 - stepped
  62949 - out
  62950 - of
  62951 - the
  62952 - Nothing
  62953 - that
  62954 - surrounded
  62955 - them
  62956 - It
  62957 - was
  62958 - a
  62959 - man
  62960 - unbowed
  62961 - and
  62962 - vigorous
  62963 - despite
  62964 - his
  62965 - obvious
  62966 - age
  62967 - He
  62968 - wore
  62969 - only
  62970 - a
  62971 - plain
  62972 - white
  62973 - robe
  62974 - a
  62975 - little
  62976 - like
  62977 - a
  62978 - toga
  62979 - The
  62980 - Old
  62981 - One
  62982 - said
  62983 - Arthur
  62984 - Free
  62985 - from
  62986 - the
  62987 - clock
  62988 - ”
  62989 - Freed
  62990 - by
  62991 - your
  62992 - hand
  62993 - Arthur
  62994 - said
  62995 - the
  62996 - Old
  62997 - One
  62998 - For
  62999 - which
  63000 - I
  63001 - give
  63002 - you
  63003 - thanks

  63005 - But…what
  63006 - is
  63007 - happening
  63008 - ”
  63009 - asked
  63010 - Arthur
  63011 - Why
  63012 - is
  63013 - the
  63014 - Will…we
  63015 - have
  63016 - to
  63017 - stop
  63018 - the
  63019 - Nothing

  63021 - everything
  63022 - be
  63023 - destroyed

  63025 - this
  63026 - last
  63027 - part
  63028 - of
  63029 - the
  63030 - Garden

  63032 - The
  63033 - whole

  63035 - Everything
  63036 - ”
  63037 - Yes
  63038 - said
  63039 - the
  63040 - Old
  63041 - One
  63042 - He
  63043 - walked
  63044 - over
  63045 - to
  63046 - the
  63047 - column
  63048 - of
  63049 - words
  63050 - that
  63051 - was
  63052 - the
  63053 - Will
  63054 - and
  63055 - stepped
  63056 - into
  63057 - it
  63058 - As
  63059 - he
  63060 - did
  63061 - so
  63062 - Nothing
  63063 - crashed
  63064 - in
  63065 - The
  63066 - Elysium
  63067 - was
  63068 - annihilated
  63069 - in
  63070 - that
  63071 - final
  63072 - wave
  63073 - of
  63074 - Nothing
  63075 - and
  63076 - with
  63077 - its
  63078 - destruction
  63079 - so
  63080 - too
  63081 - the
  63082 - Secondary
  63083 - Realms
  63084 - were
  63085 - destroyed
  63086 - every

  63089 - and
  63090 - planet
  63091 - including

  63095 - its
  63096 - people

  63098 - and
  63099 - wonders
  63100 - The
  63101 - Architect‘s
  63102 - Creation
  63103 - was
  63104 - no
  63105 - more
  63106 - The
  63107 - Universe

  63109 - returned
  63110 - to
  63111 - the
  63112 - Nothing
  63113 - from
  63114 - which
  63115 - it
  63116 - had
  63117 - been
  63118 - made
  63119 - CHAPTER
  63120 - TWENTY-NINE
  63121 - Arthur
  63122 - was
  63123 - alone
  63124 - in
  63125 - total
  63126 - darkness
  63127 - In
  63128 - shock
  63129 - he
  63130 - was
  63131 - unable
  63132 - to
  63133 - comprehend
  63134 - what
  63135 - had
  63136 - happened
  63137 - so
  63138 - it
  63139 - took
  63140 - him
  63141 - some
  63142 - time
  63143 - to
  63144 - work
  63145 - out
  63146 - that
  63147 - he
  63148 - was
  63149 - still
  63150 - alive
  63151 - Or
  63152 - something
  63153 - He
  63154 - was
  63155 - still
  63156 - aware
  63157 - of
  63158 - himself
  63159 - at
  63160 - least
  63161 - And
  63162 - he
  63163 - still
  63164 - had
  63165 - the
  63166 - Keys
  63167 - Light
  63168 - he
  63169 - whispered
  63170 - and
  63171 - there
  63172 - was
  63173 - light
  63174 - A
  63175 - pale
  63176 - radiance
  63177 - surrounded
  63178 - him
  63179 - though
  63180 - all
  63181 - else
  63182 - remained
  63183 - in
  63184 - darkness
  63185 - I
  63186 - am
  63187 - surrounded
  63188 - by
  63189 - Nothing

  63191 - Arthur
  63192 - Yet
  63193 - it
  63194 - has
  63195 - not
  63196 - destroyed
  63197 - me
  63198 - No
  63199 - came
  63200 - an
  63201 - unexpected
  63202 - answer
  63203 - It
  63204 - was
  63205 - the
  63206 - voice
  63207 - of
  63208 - the
  63209 - Will
  63210 - inside
  63211 - his
  63212 - head
  63213 - again
  63214 - You
  63215 - are
  63216 - too
  63217 - strong
  63218 - for
  63219 - Nothing
  63220 - to
  63221 - destroy
  63222 - you
  63223 - save
  63224 - by
  63225 - your
  63226 - own
  63227 - desire
  63228 - Arthur
  63229 - turned
  63230 - round
  63231 - There

  63294 - so

  63296 - ago

  63298 - did
  63299 - you
  63300 - destroy
  63301 - the
  63302 - House
  63303 - Why

  63305 - everything

  63307 - burst
  63308 - out

  63310 - More
  63311 - than
  63312 - fifteen
  63313 - billion
  63314 - years
  63315 - ago
  63316 - as
  63317 - mortals
  63318 - count
  63319 - time
  63320 - I
  63321 - made
  63322 - the
  63323 - stars
  63324 - and
  63325 - waited
  63326 - while
  63327 - planets
  63328 - were
  63329 - born
  63330 - I
  63331 - watched
  63332 - as
  63333 - life
  63334 - began
  63335 - But
  63336 - it
  63337 - was
  63338 - slow
  63339 - so
  63340 - slow
  63341 - even
  63342 - for
  63343 - such
  63344 - as
  63345 - I…I
  63346 - thought
  63347 - to
  63348 - intervene
  63349 - and
  63350 - chose
  63351 - to
  63352 - separate
  63353 - part
  63354 - of
  63355 - my
  63356 - nature
  63357 - to
  63358 - create
  63359 - a

  63363 - would

  63368 - it

  63372 - the
  63373 - Old

  63375 - from
  63376 - myself

  63380 - and
  63381 - the
  63382 - work
  63383 - went
  63384 - well
  63385 - most
  63386 - particularly
  63387 - with
  63388 - the
  63389 - advent
  63390 - of
  63391 - you
  63392 - mortals
  63393 - something
  63394 - I
  63395 - did
  63396 - not

  63398 - I
  63399 - did
  63400 - not
  63401 - anticipate
  63402 - that
  63403 - the
  63404 - Old
  63405 - One
  63406 - would
  63407 - grow
  63408 - apart
  63409 - from
  63410 - me
  63411 - and
  63412 - disagree
  63413 - We
  63414 - fought
  63415 - and
  63416 - my
  63417 - anger
  63418 - grew
  63419 - till
  63420 - at
  63421 - last
  63422 - I
  63423 - chained
  63424 - him
  63425 - and
  63426 - made
  63427 - him
  63428 - suffer
  63429 - Yet
  63430 - it
  63431 - was
  63432 - also
  63433 - I

  63439 - this
  63440 - got
  63441 - to
  63442 - do
  63443 - with

  63445 - you

  63449 - whispered
  63450 - Arthur
  63451 - He
  63452 - still
  63453 - couldn‘t
  63454 - believe
  63455 - what
  63456 - had
  63457 - happened
  63458 - He
  63459 - could
  63460 - still
  63461 - see
  63462 - Leaf‘s
  63463 - face
  63464 - and
  63465 - hear
  63466 - her

  63468 - out
  63469 - Billions
  63470 - of
  63471 - years

  63473 - the
  63474 - Architect
  63475 - Billions
  63476 - of
  63477 - years…You
  63478 - cannot
  63479 - yet
  63480 - comprehend
  63481 - how
  63482 - tired
  63483 - I
  63484 - became
  63485 - despite
  63486 - all
  63487 - efforts
  63488 - to
  63489 - amuse
  63490 - and
  63491 - distract
  63492 - myself
  63493 - The
  63494 - House
  63495 - was
  63496 - one
  63497 - such
  63498 - entertainment
  63499 - inspired
  63500 - by
  63501 - mortals
  63502 - Our
  63503 - children
  63504 - were
  63505 - another
  63506 - and
  63507 - they
  63508 - did
  63509 - distract
  63510 - me
  63511 - for
  63512 - a
  63513 - time
  63514 - But
  63515 - time
  63516 - is
  63517 - a
  63518 - weighty
  63519 - burden
  63520 - and
  63521 - all
  63522 - distractions
  63523 - fade
  63524 - I
  63525 - grew
  63526 - to
  63527 - wonder
  63528 - what
  63529 - might
  63530 - lie
  63531 - beyond
  63532 - time
  63533 - what
  63534 - might
  63535 - be
  63536 - found
  63537 - beyond
  63538 - my
  63539 - own
  63540 - existence
  63541 - Ten
  63542 - thousand
  63543 - years
  63544 - ago
  63545 - my
  63546 - anger
  63547 - with
  63548 - the
  63549 - Old
  63550 - One
  63551 - finally
  63552 - cooled
  63553 - and
  63554 - I
  63555 - found
  63556 - that
  63557 - this
  63558 - rage
  63559 - alone
  63560 - had
  63561 - sustained
  63562 - me
  63563 - for
  63564 - that
  63565 - time
  63566 - I
  63567 - was
  63568 - weary
  63569 - so
  63570 - weary
  63571 - and
  63572 - I
  63573 - wished
  63574 - to
  63575 - go
  63576 - beyond
  63577 - I
  63578 - decided
  63579 - to
  63580 - give
  63581 - myself
  63582 - to
  63583 - Nothing…but
  63584 - I
  63585 - could
  63586 - not
  63587 - I
  63588 - was
  63589 - held
  63590 - back
  63591 - because
  63592 - I
  63593 - was
  63594 - not
  63595 - whole
  63596 - The
  63597 - Old
  63598 - One
  63599 - anchored
  63600 - me
  63601 - in
  63602 - this
  63603 - Universe
  63604 - for
  63605 - in
  63606 - my
  63607 - rage
  63608 - I
  63609 - had
  63610 - made
  63611 - his
  63612 - bonds
  63613 - eternal
  63614 - to
  63615 - last
  63616 - as
  63617 - long
  63618 - as
  63619 - my
  63620 - Creation
  63621 - I
  63622 - could
  63623 - not
  63624 - release
  63625 - the
  63626 - Old
  63627 - One
  63628 - and
  63629 - so
  63630 - free
  63631 - myself
  63632 - without
  63633 - destroying
  63634 - everything
  63635 - I
  63636 - had
  63637 - made
  63638 - the
  63639 - House
  63640 - and
  63641 - all
  63642 - the
  63643 - Universe
  63644 - beyond
  63645 - So
  63646 - I
  63647 - began
  63648 - that
  63649 - process
  63650 - of
  63651 - destruction
  63652 - with
  63653 - the
  63654 - fracture
  63655 - of
  63656 - myself
  63657 - and
  63658 - the
  63659 - making
  63660 - of
  63661 - the
  63662 - Will
  63663 - It
  63664 - should
  63665 - have
  63666 - been
  63667 - quickly
  63668 - executed
  63669 - but
  63670 - the
  63671 - Trustees
  63672 - had
  63673 - grown
  63674 - disobedient
  63675 - and
  63676 - they
  63677 - would
  63678 - not
  63679 - perform
  63680 - the
  63681 - actions
  63682 - that
  63683 - would
  63684 - lead
  63685 - to
  63686 - their
  63687 - own
  63688 - demise
  63689 - Yet
  63690 - they
  63691 - could
  63692 - not
  63693 - entirely
  63694 - resist
  63695 - the
  63696 - powers
  63697 - of
  63698 - my
  63699 - Will
  63700 - In
  63701 - time
  63702 - it
  63703 - twisted
  63704 - their
  63705 - natures…and
  63706 - so
  63707 - unwittingly
  63708 - they
  63709 - came
  63710 - to
  63711 - work
  63712 - to
  63713 - my
  63714 - desired
  63715 - end
  63716 - But
  63717 - why
  63718 - me

  63720 - asked
  63721 - Arthur
  63722 - Why
  63723 - choose
  63724 - me
  63725 - Couldn‘t
  63726 - you
  63727 - just
  63728 - have
  63729 - got
  63730 - a
  63731 - Denizen
  63732 - to
  63733 - do
  63734 - your
  63735 - dirty
  63736 - work
  63737 - ”
  63738 - No
  63739 - It
  63740 - had
  63741 - to
  63742 - be
  63743 - a
  63744 - mortal
  63745 - someone
  63746 - who
  63747 - can
  63748 - create
  63749 - Denizens
  63750 - were
  63751 - made
  63752 - directly
  63753 - by
  63754 - me
  63755 - and
  63756 - can
  63757 - only
  63758 - copy
  63759 - I
  63760 - made
  63761 - the
  63762 - basic
  63763 - stuff
  63764 - from
  63765 - which
  63766 - you
  63767 - mortals
  63768 - evolved
  63769 - Arthur
  63770 - with
  63771 - some
  63772 - tinkering
  63773 - here
  63774 - and
  63775 - there
  63776 - but
  63777 - I
  63778 - did
  63779 - not
  63780 - make
  63781 - you
  63782 - directly…and
  63783 - you
  63784 - mortals
  63785 - surpass
  63786 - even
  63787 - Us
  63788 - with

  63794 - need
  63795 - to
  63796 - be
  63797 - creative

  63799 - asked
  63800 - Arthur
  63801 - bitterly
  63802 - I‘ve
  63803 - done
  63804 - what
  63805 - you
  63806 - needed
  63807 - haven‘t
  63808 - I
  63809 - I
  63810 - guess
  63811 - we
  63812 - can
  63813 - both
  63814 - just
  63815 - dissolve

  63826 - You

  63829 - New

  63833 - exclaimed
  63834 - Arthur
  63835 - though
  63836 - it
  63837 - was
  63838 - not
  63839 - really
  63840 - a
  63841 - surprise

  63843 - the
  63844 - old

  63864 - asked
  63865 - Arthur
  63866 - quietly
  63867 - He
  63868 - felt
  63869 - very
  63870 - much
  63871 - a
  63872 - boy
  63873 - again
  63874 - alone
  63875 - and
  63876 - lost
  63877 - I
  63878 - liked

  63883 - That
  63884 - is

  63888 - the
  63889 - Architect
  63890 - Farewell
  63891 - The
  63892 - Architect
  63893 - shut
  63894 - her
  63895 - eyes
  63896 - and
  63897 - lay
  63898 - back
  63899 - as
  63900 - if
  63901 - settling
  63902 - down
  63903 - to
  63904 - sleep
  63905 - Nothing
  63906 - spread
  63907 - across
  63908 - her
  63909 - like
  63910 - a
  63911 - blanket
  63912 - She
  63913 - smiled
  63914 - and
  63915 - pulled
  63916 - it
  63917 - up
  63918 - over
  63919 - her
  63920 - head
  63921 - and
  63922 - then
  63923 - there
  63924 - was
  63925 - only
  63926 - Arthur‘s
  63927 - light
  63928 - the
  63929 - only
  63930 - light
  63931 - anywhere
  63932 - in
  63933 - existence
  63934 - Arthur
  63935 - looked
  63936 - at
  63937 - his
  63938 - hands
  63939 - How
  63940 - do

  63942 - make
  63943 - a…a

  63946 - he
  63947 - shouted
  63948 - The
  63949 - Keys
  63950 - answered
  63951 - him
  63952 - Not
  63953 - in
  63954 - words
  63955 - He
  63956 - felt
  63957 - their
  63958 - power
  63959 - coursing
  63960 - within
  63961 - him
  63962 - and
  63963 - something
  63964 - changed
  63965 - in
  63966 - his
  63967 - head
  63968 - The
  63969 - boy
  63970 - who
  63971 - had
  63972 - been
  63973 - Arthur
  63974 - and
  63975 - had
  63976 - become
  63977 - something
  63978 - more
  63979 - finally
  63980 - completed
  63981 - his
  63982 - transformation
  63983 - He
  63984 - was
  63985 - no
  63986 - longer
  63987 - Arthur
  63988 - He
  63989 - was
  63990 - the
  63991 - New
  63992 - Architect
  63993 - and
  63994 - now
  63995 - he
  63996 - knew
  63997 - how
  63998 - to
  63999 - use
  64000 - his
  64001 - power
  64002 - how
  64003 - to
  64004 - shape
  64005 - the
  64006 - stuff
  64007 - of
  64008 - Nothing
  64009 - how
  64010 - to
  64011 - direct
  64012 - it
  64013 - on
  64014 - a
  64015 - cosmic
  64016 - scale
  64017 - He
  64018 - just
  64019 - had
  64020 - to
  64021 - decide
  64022 - what
  64023 - he
  64024 - wanted
  64025 - to
  64026 - make
  64027 - The
  64028 - easiest
  64029 - thing
  64030 - would
  64031 - be
  64032 - to
  64033 - create
  64034 - a
  64035 - raw
  64036 - new
  64037 - Universe
  64038 - of
  64039 - simple
  64040 - matter
  64041 - mostly
  64042 - hydrogen
  64043 - and
  64044 - set
  64045 - some
  64046 - basic
  64047 - reactions
  64048 - going
  64049 - In
  64050 - a
  64051 - few
  64052 - billion
  64053 - years
  64054 - there
  64055 - would
  64056 - be
  64057 - suns
  64058 - and
  64059 - planets
  64060 - and
  64061 - perhaps
  64062 - billions
  64063 - of
  64064 - years
  64065 - after
  64066 - that
  64067 - the
  64068 - beginnings
  64069 - of
  64070 - organic
  64071 - life
  64072 - The
  64073 - New
  64074 - Architect
  64075 - was
  64076 - tempted
  64077 - by
  64078 - this
  64079 - He
  64080 - could
  64081 - make
  64082 - that
  64083 - Universe
  64084 - but
  64085 - accelerate
  64086 - things
  64087 - He
  64088 - wouldn‘t
  64089 - make
  64090 - the
  64091 - mistake
  64092 - of
  64093 - the
  64094 - Architect
  64095 - in
  64096 - separating
  64097 - a
  64098 - part
  64099 - of
  64100 - himself
  64101 - to
  64102 - speed
  64103 - things
  64104 - up
  64105 - He
  64106 - would
  64107 - do
  64108 - it
  64109 - himself
  64110 - It
  64111 - would
  64112 - be
  64113 - like
  64114 - tending
  64115 - a
  64116 - garden
  64117 - with
  64118 - steady
  64119 - work
  64120 - in
  64121 - most
  64122 - of
  64123 - it
  64124 - with
  64125 - special
  64126 - parts
  64127 - that
  64128 - got
  64129 - concentrated
  64130 - attention
  64131 - It
  64132 - would
  64133 - be
  64134 - fascinating
  64135 - to
  64136 - see
  64137 - what
  64138 - grew
  64139 - and
  64140 - he
  64141 - could
  64142 - direct
  64143 - it
  64144 - in
  64145 - particular
  64146 - ways…
  64147 - Deep
  64148 - inside
  64149 - the
  64150 - New
  64151 - Architect
  64152 - the
  64153 - part
  64154 - of
  64155 - him
  64156 - that
  64157 - was
  64158 - Arthur
  64159 - cried
  64160 - out
  64161 - a
  64162 - cry
  64163 - of
  64164 - such
  64165 - savage
  64166 - pain
  64167 - and
  64168 - loss
  64169 - that
  64170 - it
  64171 - halted
  64172 - the
  64173 - New
  64174 - Architect‘s
  64175 - thoughts
  64176 - of
  64177 - a
  64178 - raw
  64179 - young
  64180 - Universe
  64181 - begun
  64182 - from
  64183 - the
  64184 - beginning
  64185 - No
  64186 - said
  64187 - the
  64188 - New
  64189 - Architect
  64190 - to
  64191 - himself
  64192 - to
  64193 - the
  64194 - Arthur
  64195 - that
  64196 - he
  64197 - had
  64198 - been
  64199 - No…you
  64200 - are
  64201 - quite
  64202 - right
  64203 - ”
  64204 - As
  64205 - he
  64206 - understood
  64207 - everything
  64208 - now
  64209 - the
  64210 - New
  64211 - Architect
  64212 - knew
  64213 - what
  64214 - the
  64215 - Architect
  64216 - had
  64217 - meant
  64218 - when
  64219 - she
  64220 - had
  64221 - said
  64222 - That
  64223 - is
  64224 - your
  64225 - choice
  64226 - ”
  64227 - He
  64228 - gestured
  64229 - and
  64230 - a
  64231 - stone
  64232 - formed
  64233 - beside
  64234 - him
  64235 - A
  64236 - small
  64237 - boulder
  64238 - of
  64239 - pleasantly
  64240 - weathered
  64241 - granite
  64242 - It
  64243 - was
  64244 - exactly
  64245 - like
  64246 - the
  64247 - one
  64248 - that
  64249 - had
  64250 - stood
  64251 - near
  64252 - the
  64253 - spring
  64254 - in
  64255 - the
  64256 - Elysium
  64257 - The
  64258 - New
  64259 - Architect
  64260 - sat
  64261 - on
  64262 - the
  64263 - stone
  64264 - reached
  64265 - into
  64266 - his
  64267 - coat
  64268 - and
  64269 - drew
  64270 - out
  64271 - A
  64272 - Complete
  64273 - Atlas
  64274 - of
  64275 - the
  64276 - House
  64277 - and
  64278 - Immediate
  64279 - Environs
  64280 - He
  64281 - did
  64282 - not
  64283 - open
  64284 - it
  64285 - but
  64286 - simply
  64287 - knew
  64288 - its
  64289 - contents
  64290 - as
  64291 - soon
  64292 - as
  64293 - he
  64294 - held
  64295 - it
  64296 - in
  64297 - his
  64298 - hand
  64299 - It
  64300 - contained
  64301 - a
  64302 - complete
  64303 - snapshot
  64304 - of
  64305 - the
  64306 - former
  64307 - Universe
  64308 - taken
  64309 - a
  64310 - moment
  64311 - before
  64312 - the
  64313 - destruction
  64314 - of
  64315 - the
  64316 - Elysium
  64317 - of
  64318 - the
  64319 - Incomparable
  64320 - Gardens
  64321 - when
  64322 - the
  64323 - Will
  64324 - had
  64325 - frozen
  64326 - everyone
  64327 - All
  64328 - the
  64329 - records
  64330 - of
  64331 - the
  64332 - Secondary
  64333 - Realms
  64334 - slavishly
  64335 - made
  64336 - by
  64337 - thousands
  64338 - upon
  64339 - thousands
  64340 - of
  64341 - Denizens
  64342 - were
  64343 - just
  64344 - a
  64345 - small
  64346 - and
  64347 - largely
  64348 - irrelevant
  64349 - part
  64350 - of
  64351 - the
  64352 - true
  64353 - record
  64354 - The
  64355 - Old
  64356 - Universe
  64357 - in
  64358 - all
  64359 - its
  64360 - fine
  64361 - detail
  64362 - lay
  64363 - in
  64364 - the
  64365 - palm
  64366 - of
  64367 - his
  64368 - hand
  64369 - The
  64370 - New
  64371 - Architect
  64372 - sighed
  64373 - as
  64374 - he
  64375 - thought
  64376 - about
  64377 - the
  64378 - work
  64379 - ahead
  64380 - He
  64381 - had
  64382 - planned
  64383 - to
  64384 - tweak
  64385 - things
  64386 - here
  64387 - or
  64388 - there
  64389 - particularly
  64390 - on
  64391 - Earth
  64392 - but
  64393 - now
  64394 - he
  64395 - knew
  64396 - he
  64397 - could
  64398 - not
  64399 - for
  64400 - that
  64401 - would
  64402 - endlessly
  64403 - complicate
  64404 - his
  64405 - task
  64406 - If
  64407 - he
  64408 - was
  64409 - to
  64410 - remake
  64411 - the
  64412 - Universe
  64413 - he
  64414 - would
  64415 - have
  64416 - to
  64417 - do
  64418 - so
  64419 - exactly
  64420 - as
  64421 - it
  64422 - was
  64423 - recorded
  64424 - in
  64425 - the
  64426 - Atlas
  64427 - That
  64428 - meant
  64429 - the
  64430 - Secondary
  64431 - Realms
  64432 - would
  64433 - be
  64434 - no
  64435 - different
  64436 - and
  64437 - all
  64438 - that
  64439 - would
  64440 - remain
  64441 - of
  64442 - the
  64443 - House
  64444 - would
  64445 - be
  64446 - the
  64447 - Elysium
  64448 - But
  64449 - there
  64450 - was
  64451 - one
  64452 - difference
  64453 - he
  64454 - would
  64455 - make
  64456 - He
  64457 - had
  64458 - dismissed
  64459 - the
  64460 - notion
  64461 - when
  64462 - thinking
  64463 - of
  64464 - a
  64465 - new
  64466 - Universe
  64467 - but
  64468 - on
  64469 - reflection
  64470 - he
  64471 - had
  64472 - come
  64473 - to
  64474 - decide
  64475 - it
  64476 - would
  64477 - be
  64478 - a
  64479 - good
  64480 - idea
  64481 - At
  64482 - least
  64483 - it
  64484 - would
  64485 - give
  64486 - him
  64487 - some
  64488 - personal
  64489 - satisfaction
  64490 - a
  64491 - little
  64492 - counterweight
  64493 - to
  64494 - the
  64495 - sadness
  64496 - that
  64497 - lingered
  64498 - inside
  64499 - him
  64500 - a
  64501 - legacy
  64502 - of
  64503 - his
  64504 - mortal
  64505 - past
  64506 - The
  64507 - New
  64508 - Architect
  64509 - rested
  64510 - his
  64511 - chin
  64512 - on
  64513 - his
  64514 - hand
  64515 - his
  64516 - elbow
  64517 - on
  64518 - his
  64519 - knee
  64520 - and
  64521 - began
  64522 - to
  64523 - think
  64524 - CHAPTER
  64525 - THIRTY
  64526 - Arthur
  64527 - blinked
  64528 - and
  64529 - choked
  64530 - back
  64531 - a
  64532 - surge
  64533 - of
  64534 - nausea
  64535 - The
  64536 - sun
  64537 - was
  64538 - too
  64539 - bright
  64540 - and
  64541 - his
  64542 - legs
  64543 - felt
  64544 - weak…so
  64545 - weak
  64546 - that
  64547 - they
  64548 - began
  64549 - to
  64550 - crumple
  64551 - underneath
  64552 - him
  64553 - He
  64554 - quickly
  64555 - sat
  64556 - down
  64557 - on
  64558 - the
  64559 - grass
  64560 - and
  64561 - noticed
  64562 - that
  64563 - not
  64564 - only
  64565 - were
  64566 - his
  64567 - legs
  64568 - not
  64569 - holding
  64570 - him
  64571 - up
  64572 - they
  64573 - were
  64574 - back
  64575 - to
  64576 - being
  64577 - normal
  64578 - boy-
  64579 - size
  64580 - and
  64581 - he
  64582 - was
  64583 - wearing
  64584 - jeans
  64585 - He
  64586 - had
  64587 - a
  64588 - T-shirt
  64589 - on
  64590 - too
  64591 - a
  64592 - vintage
  64593 - Ratz
  64594 - band
  64595 - T-shirt
  64596 - and
  64597 - his
  64598 - chest
  64599 - and
  64600 - arms
  64601 - were
  64602 - certainly
  64603 - back
  64604 - to
  64605 - normal
  64606 - as
  64607 - well
  64608 - and
  64609 - when
  64610 - he
  64611 - ran
  64612 - his
  64613 - hands
  64614 - through
  64615 - his
  64616 - hair
  64617 - it
  64618 - felt…human
  64619 - But
  64620 - a
  64621 - moment
  64622 - ago
  64623 - he
  64624 - had
  64625 - been
  64626 - the
  64627 - New
  64628 - Architect
  64629 - and
  64630 - was
  64631 - recreating
  64632 - the
  64633 - cosmos
  64634 - Now
  64635 - he
  64636 - was
  64637 - –
  64638 - Arthur
  64639 - looked
  64640 - around
  64641 - –
  64642 - now
  64643 - he
  64644 - was
  64645 - back
  64646 - in
  64647 - the
  64648 - Elysium
  64649 - An
  64650 - Elysium
  64651 - surrounded
  64652 - by
  64653 - Nothing
  64654 - Arthur
  64655 - said
  64656 - a
  64657 - somewhat
  64658 - familiar
  64659 - voice
  64660 - behind
  64661 - him
  64662 - Arthur
  64663 - turned
  64664 - round
  64665 - and
  64666 - had
  64667 - to
  64668 - shield
  64669 - his
  64670 - face
  64671 - with
  64672 - his
  64673 - hand
  64674 - There
  64675 - was
  64676 - a
  64677 - twelve-foot-tall
  64678 - shining
  64679 - winged
  64680 - figure
  64681 - there
  64682 - a
  64683 - figure
  64684 - almost
  64685 - too
  64686 - bright
  64687 - to
  64688 - look
  64689 - at
  64690 - But
  64691 - Arthur
  64692 - could
  64693 - make
  64694 - out
  64695 - the
  64696 - shining
  64697 - one‘s
  64698 - features
  64699 - –
  64700 - which
  64701 - were
  64702 - a
  64703 - stylized
  64704 - and
  64705 - improved
  64706 - version
  64707 - of

  64711 - you
  64712 - me
  64713 - ”
  64714 - asked
  64715 - Arthur
  64716 - After
  64717 - a
  64718 - fashion
  64719 - said
  64720 - the
  64721 - New
  64722 - Architect
  64723 - But…what
  64724 - am
  64725 - I
  64726 - then
  64727 - ”
  64728 - asked
  64729 - Arthur
  64730 - Apart
  64731 - from
  64732 - the
  64733 - actual
  64734 - creation
  64735 - of
  64736 - the
  64737 - new
  64738 - Universe
  64739 - he
  64740 - could
  64741 - still
  64742 - remember
  64743 - everything
  64744 - he‘d
  64745 - done
  64746 - and
  64747 - what
  64748 - he‘d
  64749 - become
  64750 - from
  64751 - that
  64752 - first
  64753 - moment
  64754 - when
  64755 - he‘d
  64756 - met
  64757 - Mister
  64758 - Monday
  64759 - and
  64760 - Sneezer
  64761 - You
  64762 - are
  64763 - yourself
  64764 - said
  64765 - the
  64766 - New
  64767 - Architect
  64768 - As
  64769 - the
  64770 - Old
  64771 - One
  64772 - was
  64773 - a
  64774 - part
  64775 - of
  64776 - the
  64777 - Architect
  64778 - so
  64779 - you
  64780 - are
  64781 - part
  64782 - of
  64783 - the
  64784 - greater
  64785 - being
  64786 - that
  64787 - we
  64788 - became
  64789 - ”
  64790 - But
  64791 - I‘m
  64792 - back
  64793 - to
  64794 - being
  64795 - a
  64796 - boy
  64797 - again
  64798 - said
  64799 - Arthur
  64800 - wonderingly
  64801 - The
  64802 - real
  64803 - me
  64804 - ”
  64805 - Yes
  64806 - said
  64807 - the
  64808 - New
  64809 - Architect
  64810 - quietly
  64811 - I
  64812 - knew
  64813 - that
  64814 - was
  64815 - what
  64816 - I
  64817 - wanted
  64818 - ”
  64819 - Am
  64820 - I
  64821 - mortal
  64822 - ”
  64823 - asked
  64824 - Arthur
  64825 - Yes
  64826 - lied
  64827 - the
  64828 - New
  64829 - Architect
  64830 - for
  64831 - his
  64832 - own
  64833 - good
  64834 - But
  64835 - you
  64836 - will
  64837 - not
  64838 - get
  64839 - sick
  64840 - ever
  64841 - again
  64842 - ”
  64843 - I
  64844 - can
  64845 - go
  64846 - back
  64847 - to
  64848 - Earth
  64849 - whispered
  64850 - Arthur
  64851 - He
  64852 - blinked
  64853 - again
  64854 - and
  64855 - casually
  64856 - wiped
  64857 - a
  64858 - tear
  64859 - from
  64860 - his
  64861 - eye
  64862 - as
  64863 - if
  64864 - it
  64865 - were
  64866 - the
  64867 - New
  64868 - Architect‘s
  64869 - brilliance
  64870 - that
  64871 - was
  64872 - making
  64873 - his
  64874 - eyes
  64875 - water
  64876 - Uh
  64877 - I
  64878 - mean…you
  64879 - did
  64880 - remake
  64881 - Earth
  64882 - ”
  64883 - Exactly
  64884 - as
  64885 - it
  64886 - was
  64887 - unfortunately
  64888 - said
  64889 - the
  64890 - New
  64891 - Architect
  64892 - Arthur…I
  64893 - was
  64894 - not
  64895 - able
  64896 - to
  64897 - remake
  64898 - everything
  64899 - as
  64900 - I…or
  64901 - you…would
  64902 - wish
  64903 - The
  64904 - Atlas
  64905 - recorded
  64906 - the
  64907 - House
  64908 - only
  64909 - minutes
  64910 - before
  64911 - the
  64912 - end…
  64913 - Yes…
  64914 - said
  64915 - Arthur
  64916 - But
  64917 - Leaf
  64918 - and
  64919 - Suzy
  64920 - and
  64921 - Fred
  64922 - and
  64923 - Dr
  64924 - Scamandros
  64925 - they
  64926 - were
  64927 - here
  64928 - they‘ll
  64929 - be—
  64930 - Leaf
  64931 - is
  64932 - here
  64933 - said
  64934 - the
  64935 - New
  64936 - Architect
  64937 - He
  64938 - gestured
  64939 - and
  64940 - Leaf
  64941 - was
  64942 - there
  64943 - asleep
  64944 - on
  64945 - the
  64946 - grass
  64947 - nearby
  64948 - I
  64949 - have
  64950 - not
  64951 - yet
  64952 - decided
  64953 - about
  64954 - the
  64955 - Denizens
  64956 - and
  64957 - the
  64958 - Piper‘s
  64959 - children
  64960 - But
  64961 - all
  64962 - those
  64963 - lost
  64964 - in
  64965 - the
  64966 - greater
  64967 - part
  64968 - of
  64969 - the
  64970 - Gardens
  64971 - I
  64972 - cannot—
  64973 - Oh

  64983 - Earth
  64984 - with
  64985 - a
  64986 - woman
  64987 - in
  64988 - it…
  64989 - Tears
  64990 - streamed
  64991 - down
  64992 - his
  64993 - face
  64994 - now
  64995 - and
  64996 - he
  64997 - made
  64998 - no
  64999 - pretence
  65000 - that
  65001 - it
  65002 - was
  65003 - from
  65004 - the
  65005 - fierceness
  65006 - of
  65007 - the
  65008 - light
  65009 - Mother

  65011 - Yes
  65012 - said
  65013 - the
  65014 - New
  65015 - Architect
  65016 - He
  65017 - hesitated
  65018 - then
  65019 - said
  65020 - I
  65021 - could
  65022 - make
  65023 - her
  65024 - again
  65025 - solely
  65026 - from
  65027 - our
  65028 - memory
  65029 - but
  65030 - she
  65031 - would
  65032 - not
  65033 - be
  65034 - exactly
  65035 - right—
  65036 - No
  65037 - ”
  65038 - shuddered
  65039 - Arthur
  65040 - He
  65041 - took
  65042 - in
  65043 - a
  65044 - deep
  65045 - breath
  65046 - and
  65047 - choked
  65048 - back
  65049 - the
  65050 - tears
  65051 - No
  65052 - ”
  65053 - I
  65054 - will
  65055 - return
  65056 - you
  65057 - and
  65058 - Leaf
  65059 - to
  65060 - a
  65061 - friendly
  65062 - house
  65063 - a
  65064 - safe
  65065 - distance
  65066 - from
  65067 - the
  65068 - bombed
  65069 - hospital
  65070 - said
  65071 - the
  65072 - New
  65073 - Architect
  65074 - It
  65075 - belongs
  65076 - to
  65077 - an
  65078 - old
  65079 - woman
  65080 - called
  65081 - Sylvie

  65086 - will
  65087 - look
  65088 - after

  65091 - Bob
  65092 - comes
  65093 - home

  65095 - Arthur
  65096 - nodded
  65097 - The
  65098 - notion
  65099 - that
  65100 - someone
  65101 - would
  65102 - be
  65103 - looking
  65104 - after
  65105 - him
  65106 - felt
  65107 - so
  65108 - utterly
  65109 - strange
  65110 - and
  65111 - at
  65112 - the
  65113 - same
  65114 - time
  65115 - so
  65116 - comforting
  65117 - that
  65118 - he
  65119 - almost
  65120 - burst
  65121 - into
  65122 - tears
  65123 - again
  65124 - Bob
  65125 - will
  65126 - need
  65127 - your
  65128 - help
  65129 - too

  65131 - the
  65132 - New

  65135 - our
  65136 - brothers
  65137 - and
  65138 - sisters

  65140 - will
  65141 - be
  65142 - difficult

  65144 - Yes
  65145 - whispered
  65146 - Arthur
  65147 - If
  65148 - you
  65149 - want
  65150 - to
  65151 - talk
  65152 - to
  65153 - me

  65155 - the
  65156 - New

  65180 - Thanks
  65181 - said
  65182 - Arthur
  65183 - He
  65184 - wiped
  65185 - his
  65186 - eyes
  65187 - and
  65188 - nose
  65189 - and
  65190 - took
  65191 - a
  65192 - deep
  65193 - breath
  65194 - I
  65195 - guess
  65196 - I‘d
  65197 - better
  65198 - get
  65199 - going
  65200 - then
  65201 - Um
  65202 - how…
  65203 - The
  65204 - New
  65205 - Architect
  65206 - pointed
  65207 - Arthur
  65208 - was
  65209 - sure
  65210 - there
  65211 - had
  65212 - been
  65213 - nothing
  65214 - there
  65215 - or
  65216 - more

  65219 - there
  65220 - had
  65221 - been
  65222 - Nothing
  65223 - there
  65224 - but
  65225 - now
  65226 - Seven
  65227 - Dials
  65228 - stood
  65229 - waiting
  65230 - the
  65231 - grandfather
  65232 - clocks
  65233 - arranged
  65234 - in
  65235 - a
  65236 - circle
  65237 - on
  65238 - the
  65239 - grass

  65241 - he
  65242 - walked
  65243 - over
  65244 - to
  65245 - the
  65246 - clocks

  65248 - woke
  65249 - She
  65250 - sat
  65251 - up
  65252 - and
  65253 - touched
  65254 - her
  65255 - shoulder
  65256 - seeming
  65257 - surprised
  65258 - by
  65259 - something
  65260 - she
  65261 - felt
  65262 - –
  65263 - or
  65264 - didn‘t
  65265 - feel
  65266 - –
  65267 - there
  65268 - Then
  65269 - she
  65270 - saw
  65271 - Arthur
  65272 - Arthur
  65273 - Is
  65274 - that
  65275 - really
  65276 - you

  65278 - She
  65279 - ran
  65280 - over
  65281 - and
  65282 - hugged
  65283 - him
  65284 - before
  65285 - stepping
  65286 - back
  65287 - awkwardly
  65288 - It

  65296 - asked
  65297 - Leaf
  65298 - What
  65299 - happened
  65300 - One
  65301 - minute
  65302 - the
  65303 - Nothing

  65305 - coming
  65306 - in

  65308 - then
  65309 - I
  65310 - just
  65311 - woke

  65319 - Arthur
  65320 - looked
  65321 - at
  65322 - the
  65323 - New
  65324 - Architect
  65325 - who
  65326 - was
  65327 - standing
  65328 - in
  65329 - clear
  65330 - view
  65331 - He
  65332 - inclined
  65333 - his
  65334 - head
  65335 - slightly
  65336 - and
  65337 - pointed
  65338 - at
  65339 - the
  65340 - clocks
  65341 - which
  65342 - began
  65343 - to
  65344 - strike
  65345 - I‘ll
  65346 - explain
  65347 - when
  65348 - we

  65352 - Arthur
  65353 - He
  65354 - took
  65355 - Leaf‘s
  65356 - hand
  65357 - and
  65358 - hurried
  65359 - to
  65360 - the
  65361 - centre
  65362 - of
  65363 - the
  65364 - circle
  65365 - of

  65368 - Dials
  65369 - will

  65393 - Yes

  65423 - radiance
  65424 - had
  65425 - considerably
  65426 - dimmed

  65428 - had
  65429 - also
  65430 - adopted
  65431 - a
  65432 - shorter
  65433 - more
  65434 - human
  65435 - size
  65436 - and
  65437 - looked
  65438 - quite
  65439 - like

  65442 - would
  65443 - look
